Throughout the ages our people have looked beyond themselves to find the answers to the many mysteries of life. Today we know that the [[Titans]], masters of the four elements, control our destinies and direct the many forces that affect our lives. [[However]], such was not always the case.  
  
[[Our]] [[Zealan]] forebears know not of the power of the [[Titans]]. Instead they worshipped the common emotions. [[Not]] realizing that feelings are popular sensations experienced by all people, the [[Zealans]] elevated the three primary emotions -- love, hate, and apathy -- to the ranks of deities.The goddess of love they named [[Amoras]], giving her the powers of nurturing happiness. To the one called [[Odion]] the [[Zealans]] attributed the emotions of hate and grief, giving him the role of warrior and protector. To stand between them, our ancestors assigned the role of arbiter and balance to [[Apathas]], ruler of indifference.  
  
[[Even]] older texts indicate that the [[Zealans]] initially believed in not three, but six such deities! [[In]] addition to the rulers of love, hate, and apathy, [[Felicitar]] controlled joy, [[Doloras]] ruled grief, and [[Timyra]] was the patron of fear. Though anthropomorphic in nature, some of them had animalistic features, such as [[Doloras]] and his torax head. Through time, however, the [[Zealans]] found it difficult and inconvenient to pay homage to so many gods and goddesses, so they elected to combine the aspects into three.  
  
A confusing aspect of the [[Zealan]] gods serves to display the fickle nature of our ancestors' beliefs. The [[Zealans]] believed that, while the deities ruled the emotions, they were also subject to them. The more [[Zealans]] who experience a particular feeling, the stronger that deity's power grew. Conversly, discarded emotions, however temporary, meant a weakened deity, forcing some to enter near-catatonic states until they gained enough followers to re-emerge. Thus, an improbable cycle took place. [[As]] [[Odion]] planted the seed of hate within one of his subjects, and as that seed grew and took root in other warriors, [[Odion]] would become more powerful, spreading the hatred even further.  
  
Though most [[Zealans]] believed they had contact with their gods through their thoughts and emotions, only the priests and a select few were allowed to speak directly to them. The [[Zealans]] constructed great mountain-side temples housing gaudy shrines to the three or six patrons. Several labyrinths were excavated and filled with deadly traps. Secret passages were made for the priests to enter, while the few [[Zealans]] who dared to seek an audience with the gods were forced to overcome the foils of the dungeons. [[Many]] died trying, few succeeded.  
  
[[Once]] before the [[Zealan]] deities, the worshipper still had to present one of the ancient seals before gaining permission to speak. These seals were round shields of wrought metal, embossed into a triad of sections, one depicting a reddish scimitar, another showing an open palm displaying a heart, and the third revealing an image of balanced scales. [[Having]] passed through the test of the great shrines and offered the appropriate icon, a [[Zealan]] follower would then be allowed to pray for a boon from one or all of the gods. Regardless of whether the plea was heeded, considerable sacrifices of animals and valuables were required. [[Rarely]] did these acts lead to any benefit, though some stories claim that the legendary [[Khumash]]-[[Gor]] first conferred with his patrons before he was able to unify the warring tribes.  
  
There is much to be learned from studying the mythology of the past. Although we know today that the powers of the [[Titans]] are -- unlike the deities of our forbears -- quite real, we can learn much about the violent and emotional personalities of our ancestors.
