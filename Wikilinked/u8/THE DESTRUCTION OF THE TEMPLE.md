The early days of the [[Great]] [[Temple]] were a dark time. The blood from the wars flowed freely as [[Pagan]] fought [[Zealan]] in the grand struggle of religious cleansing. Battles were planned and executed. Lives were lost all in the name of archaic beliefs. All the while, [[Pagans]] toiled daily to construct the [[Great]] [[Temple]] on the apex of [[Mount]] [[Morgaelin]], as commanded by the benevolent being called the [[Guardian]]. The fear of the [[Destroyer]] was strong.  
  
[[Years]] of sweat ultimately resulted the [[Temple]]'s completion. There the [[Pagan]] leaders met to focus their energies into the worship of the [[Elementals]]. Tremendous magical forces were used to collect a strange black mineral and shape it into a large, dark obelisk. [[From]] inside the [[Temple]], the followers channeled their thoughts through the obelisk to the four elements, giving them even greater power. [[Soon]] they had amassed enough energy to become the great [[Titans]] of [[Earth]], [[Water]], [[Air]], and [[Fire]].  
  
The war continued, but now the [[Pagans]] had considerable assistance. [[Lithos]] moved the lands to trap the [[Zealans]], while [[Hydros]] removed her waters from their reach. [[Pyros]]' fires raged and grew, fueled by the winds of [[Stratos]]. [[It]] was only a matter of attrition before the [[Zealans]] and their petty beliefs fell.Then came the [[Guardian]]'s final words of warning: `[[Take]] your people and depart from the [[Temple]]. The [[Destroyer]] has come.'[[As]] the [[Pagans]] left the [[Temple]], the red head of the [[Destroyer]] filled the darkened sky, its yellow orb-like eyes staring malevolently at the mountain top.  
  
Then, out from those very eyes lightning shot out, striking the [[Temple]]. A few moments later and the great edifice was no more.The cry of shock was heard throughout the land. The [[Pagans]] pleaded for the aid of the [[Titans]]. They were not disappointed. The four [[Titans]] appeared to challenge the invader. The land was all but destroyed as rock, rain, wind, and fire hailed down from above. The battle was long and fierce.Finally, however, the [[Titans]] returned victorious. The land, though scarred from the terrible fight, was still theirs.There was nothing left of the [[Temple]] -- no ruins, no stones, no dust.  
  
[[However]], there are legends that claim the great obelisk was shattered into several fragments, spewn across the island when the mountain was hit by the [[Destroyer]]'s bolts of lightning. The locations of the fragments are known only as rumors. Such stories indicate that each of the [[Titans]] possess one of the fragments, either as a source of power or to keep the other [[Titans]] in check (since the black stone seems to be an anathema to the [[Titans]]).  
  
The first fragment, called the [[Heart]] of [[Earth]], fell to [[Lithos]], who keeps it in the fabled [[[[Pit]] of [[Death]]]]. [[Hydros]] set hers, the [[Tear]] of the [[Seas]], on the floor of the ocean in a deep undersea city. The third fragment, the [[Breath]] of [[Air]], is said to be on the island of [[Stratos]]' followers. A fourth fragment fell to the lands that became the cemetery, though many years later it was given to the first five [[Sorcerers]] and used to bind the [[Titan]] of [[Fire]] to their will.  
  
There is considerable speculation about a fifth fragment. Apparently the tip of the great obelisk was seen hurling through the air almost entirely intact. [[However]], no one ever saw the item land, so its location remains a mystery.Were all of the fragments to be gathered together and taken to an area near the location of the ancient [[Temple]], it might be possible to recreate the effects of the obelisk. Of course, it to would still be necessary to fabricate a magical field of some sort to channel the energy from whatever source first gave the obelisk power.
