The [[Ship]] of [[Doom]]  
[[Many]] tales have been handed down from generation to generation about a mighty ship that sailed from the port of [[Tenebrae]]. [[It]] is said that this ship was so big that it actually dwarfed the palace of the [[Tempest]] and needed a crew of hundreds! [[Many]] years ago, a bitter winter buried the city up to its roof tops in ice, threatening to destroy all the food supplies, and to freeze to death all the town's inhabitants. Since no one could explain the reason for the foul winter, it was decided that a great ship be sent to find and appease whatever was causing this disaster. The ship was to sail to a distant shore, carrying the wealth of all the citizens in hopes of rescuing the city and its inhabitants.  
  
This ship it is said departed laden with the wealth of the city just before the water around the port of [[Tenebrae]] froze solid. Because the sea was freezing in its wake, no ships could be sent to follow. [[It]] sailed away into a dark and forbidding twilight. The ship never did return, and most think that it went to the bottom of the sea. [[But]] some say that it found a distant shore and completed its mission, pointing to the fact that the winter storms faded away days after the ship's departure, never to return either.  
  
[[Some]] old timers say that the ship still sails upon the sea, frozen in a huge block of ice, its riches and crew a silent offering to whatever sent the wintry storms.Though most will tell you this is a myth, some of the older ones will swear that the story of the ship is true. To whoever is of sound heart and steady of sword, the riches, and the dangers, await you in the hull of a frozen ship. A ship that has sailed off into, the zone of twilight.
