ON SORCEROUS WAYS...  
[[Corodin]] of [[Argentrock]]  
  
Foreword: Sorcery is the magic of Fire. Destruction is the [[Sorcerer]]'s bailiwick. Being first and foremost an Adept Theurgist of the Order of Enlightenment, I find it hard to reconcile this power with my training as a healer. However, were it not for the Cabal's efforts, our island would have long since perished beneath the ash and lava pouring from the volcano. Some of my Acolytes feel that having this power gives us an elevated status. I cannot agree. Our power gives us the ability to fulfill a duty to our people. No more, no less.  
  
The Pentacle: This is the first instrument we of the Cabal found to use in dealing with the [[Lord of Flame]]. It can contain and bind him if properly prepared and administered. Fire flows first through the medium of the pentacle, before being shaped by the [[Sorcerer]]. The lines of the pentacle serve different purposes in the web of an enchantment. The outer ring, called the periferon, is a barrier, or ward if you will, that allows a [[Sorcerer]] to conjure with safety. The lines of the interior are divided into two groups: the conducia that touch points on the periferon, and the inner pentagon, called the locus. The points where the conducia touch periferon each have a designation that relates to their distance from the volcano. The farthest point is called the aphelion, the middle two are mesostelae. [[Mesostel]] pa sits to the right of the aphelion, while mesostel ze is to the left. The final points, closest to the volcano are appropriately named perivolcanae. [[Perivolcan]] pa is on the right and perivolcan ze is on the left.  
  
The Candle: The basis for the use of candles in Sorcery is merely to aid in focusing the [[Sorcerer]]'s will upon the proper enchantment. A black candle incorporates ash with wax to temper the will with order, while red candles, use blood and wax to free the [[Sorcerer]]'s imagination.  
  
The Reagent: The relevance that reagents have to a spell are two-fold. They provide additional energies for the [[Sorcerer]]'s use as well as assisting in the formation of the proper spell. Their portions and proximity to each of the candles around the periferon are extremely important and not to be tampered with. Experimentation is only to be attempted in the presence of a full complement of assisting [[Acoytes]].  
  
The Focus: A focus in [[Theurgy]] is a purified icon of the spell that the Theurgist concentrates upon to release his inner power. Not so in Sorcery. A focus is merely a receptacle of power. Great amounts of energy are spent to attune a spell to a focus and empower it, but once it is infused, only a minor exertion of willpower unleashes the charge of the spell. Depending upon the size, makeup, and configuration of the focus, as well as the energy of the caster, a number of these charges will be available upon a successful binding.
