I -really- do appreciate your plight, [[Avatar]].  
[[Ah]], [[Avatar]], the thrill of conquest is so... invigorating.  
[[Enjoying]] your stay on [[Pagan]], [[Avatar]]?  
[[Hark]]! [[Is]] that the sweet song of lamentation I hear?  
I do so enjoy the cries of torment.  
[[Yes]], [[Avatar]], seek a way home.  
There is no escape from -this- prison!  
[[Hurry]], [[Avatar]]. [[After]] all, you have only -all- -of- -eternity- to complete your tasks.  
[[Nystul]] sends his best, [[Avatar]]...  
You should hear the pleas for help, [[Avatar]].  
[[At]] this very moment, [[Britannia]] burns.  
[[One]] world lies in ruin, nothing more than a charred shell. The other will soon follow.  
[[Perhaps]] I should destroy you now.  
[[Care]] you no more for your own world, [[Avatar]]?  
Will your precious [[Earth]] fall so easily?  
[[Soon]] I shall be able to call [[Britannia]] mine. [[It]] seems, [[Avatar]], that you are missed here.  
Why, I believe I hear [[Lord]] [[British]] crying out for you now...  
Your treasured [[Britannia]] succumbs easily. [[Soon]] -all- the land will be mine.  
[[Ouch]]! -[[That]]- must have hurt, [[Avatar]]!  
[[Do]] not go near -that-, [[Avatar]].  
ha hahahaha  
he he he he  
[[Feel]] my wrath!  
[[Let]] the darkness come for you, [[Avatar]].
