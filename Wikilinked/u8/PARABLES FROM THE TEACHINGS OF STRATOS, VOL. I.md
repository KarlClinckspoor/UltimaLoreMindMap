PARABLES FROM THE TEACHINGS OF STRATOS, VOL. I  
  
The way of [[Stratos]] is the way of truth. There are none that can deny this. Above all, the follower of [[Stratos]] loves the way of truth and will seek it above all else in companions. [[Beware]] the way of lies and falsehoods. [[It]]'s path is broad and its lure is sweet. The way of truth is the harder road, its brambles will tear at your heart. You may feel you are ready for this hardship, but it will strike you close to your heart.  
  
[[Once]] a follower of [[Stratos]] was called before the town magistrate to give testimony against a thief who had stolen bread. When the thief entered the room and was unmasked, the [[Acolyte]] was horrified to find it was her brother. [[She]] felt she had to lie and claim no knowledge of the theft, for to tell the truth would cost her brother his right hand. [[Her]] false words bought her brother his freedom, yet the child of [[Stratos]] still felt a heavy heart. [[Not]] more than three days later her brother was slain while trying to steal more food. Had she only reached to [[Stratos]] for guidance and found the strength to speak the truth before the magistrate, her brother would have lost only his hand, not his life. [[Truth]] is the only way of [[Stratos]].
