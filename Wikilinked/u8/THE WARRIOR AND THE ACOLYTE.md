[[Good]] reader, I wish to tell you a story I heard about a warrior named [[Yevaud]]. [[He]] was a mighty fighter and was never bested in battle. Challengers came from across the land and they all fell before him. [[One]] day an [[Acolyte]] of [[Stratos]] was healing the wounds [[Yevaud]] had inflicted upon a challenger. [[As]] the [[Acolyte]] worked, [[Yevaud]] approached. 'You there,' [[Yevaud]] said. 'You will surely agree that there is no one better than I.' The [[Acolyte]] looked up at the warrior. '[[That]] is not true.' 'What?!' roared the big man. 'This is one who is better than you,' the [[Acolyte]] said. 'Who?! Who is better than me?' he bellowed. '[[Meet]] me here tomorrow and I will make him known to you,' said the [[Acolyte]].  
  
When the next day came, [[Yevaud]] arrived at the appointed spot. [[He]] found the [[Acolyte]] sitting beneath a tree. 'I am here. Lead me to the upstart,' [[Yevaud]] said. The [[Acolyte]] got to his feet. '[[Follow]] me and I will take you where you may find him. [[Yevaud]] followed the [[Acolyte]] as they walked toward the mountains. When they reached the sheer face of the cliffs, the [[Acolyte]] pointed to a cavern opening. '[[In]] there you will find one who is better than you.' said the [[Acolyte]]. [[Yevaud]] drew his mighty sword and bravely entered the cave. All was silent for a moment, then a horrible bellowing was heard and the buzzing of many [[Mandril]].  
  
A short while later, [[Yevaud]] emerged from the cavern. [[He]] was exhausted and bloody. '[[Acolyte]]!' he cried. 'There were only [[Mandril]] in that cave!' '[[Yes]],' the [[Acolyte]] answered. 'Those mandril have been plaguing this area for quite some time. Why, just last week they killed a small child.' '[[But]] you said in there I would find one who was better than I!' said the fighter. 'There was, for by killing those [[Mandril]], you used your sword for a good purpose rather than destruction. Therefore, the man who walked out of the cave was a better man than the one who walked into the cave.' [[And]] that is my story, friend. For you see, weapons destroy, but wit builds.
