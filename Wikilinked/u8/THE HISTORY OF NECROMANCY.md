[[So]] that none may forget the origins of the [[Necromantic]] order I, [[Galious]] do now put pen to paper, and hereby record the acts of [[Moriens]] the [[Necromancer]]. [[Before]] the time of the [[Necromancers]], the [[Titans]] wreaked havoc upon the world as was their want. The people suffered and many were killed at the hands of the immortal [[Titans]]. The most terrible and powerful of all of the [[Titans]] was [[Lithos]], the [[Titan]] of [[Earth]], called The [[Mountain]] [[King]]. [[Lithos]] shook the world and destroyed all that man built. [[He]] ripped open the ground and into [[His]] maw the people did tumble and satisfy The [[Mountain]] [[King]]'s hunger. The people lived in darkness and were afraid of the [[Titans]]. Therefore, none dared to confront Them.  
  
Then one day, a very brave and wise man named [[Moriens]] came forth. 'Why does the [[Mountain]] [[King]] kill our people?' asked [[Moriens]]. No one could answer [[Moriens]]' question, so [[Moriens]] sought out the [[Mountain]] [[King]] to find out why [[He]] did loose [[His]] wrath upon the land. [[Long]] did [[Moriens]] seek the mighty [[Titan]] and did finally meet the [[Lord]] of [[Earth]] in the [[Hall]] of the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. There, in the [[Mountain]] [[King]]'s hall did [[Lithos]], the [[Lord]] of the [[Netherworld]], tell [[Moriens]] of the people's failure to properly worship the greatest of all [[Titans]]. Then did [[Lithos]] command [[Moriens]] to return to his surface world and from that day on, [[Moriens]] was to offer up the dead to [[Lithos]], so that the [[Mountain]] [[King]] might be served as befits a mighty [[Titan]].  
  
[[Moriens]] returned to his surface world and carried [[Lithos]]' message to the people. Since that day, the people of the world may choose to worship which ever [[Titan]] they so desire while they live upon the surface of the world. Yet when they enter the grave, all become [[Lithos]]' subject for the rest of eternity. The people accepted [[Lithos]]' command, and the [[Earth]] [[Titan]] did cease to ravage the land and the people who did live upon [[His]] back. The [[Mountain]] [[King]] did make [[Moriens]] [[His]] [[Necromancer]] and thus did teach [[Moriens]] the magic and the power of the [[Necromancer]].  
  
[[Long]] did the wise and brave [[Moriens]] serve [[Lithos]]. [[But]], as is the way for all mortals, [[Moriens]] did grow old and sick. Knowing that he too must enter into the grave and join his lord in the [[Netherworld]], [[Moriens]] consulted [[Lithos]] on who should follow him as the [[Necromancer]]. The [[Lord]] of [[Earth]] did instruct [[His]] servant to find a suitable and worthy person to follow in [[Moriens]]' path and to become [[Moriens]]' successor when [[Moriens]] did die. Thereby did [[Galious]] of [[Tenebrae]] become the first [[Scion]] in the [[Necromantic]] line.  
  
[[Before]] [[Moriens]]' death, the [[Mountain]] [[King]] chose to reward [[Moriens]] for his service. [[Lithos]] taught the [[Necromancer]] the [[Ceremony]] of [[Eternity]], by which, the [[Necromancer]] would be allowed passage into [[Hall]] of [[Eternity]], and sit at the right hand of the [[Titan]] and counsel his eternal [[Lord]]. Then, [[Moriens]] did return to the surface for the last time. [[He]] did teach me the [[Ceremony]] of [[Eterity]] and I, in turn did send him to the [[Mountain]] [[King]].  
  
This is so done and written by my hand upon my day of confirmation by [[Lithos]], [[Lord]] of the [[Netherworld]], the [[Mountain]] [[King]], mightiest of all [[Titans]]. -[[Galious]] of [[Tenebrae]], [[Necromancer]].
