guardsman 
Guardsman! 
[[Have]] you no sense? Run for cover! The [[Titans]] rain death from above and below. We are doomed! 
The walking dead overrun the city! Find shelter and protect yourself! 
Why do you bother me this time? 
[[How]] can I assist you? 
What? Again with the questions! 
What do you want, stranger? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
Bye 
[[How]] could my name possibly be of any importance to you? 
[[Only]] mindless fools go around asking every stranger they meet their name. 
[[My]] job is to guard the new [[Tempest]], of course. 
[[My]] job is to guard her Ladyship [[Mordea]], of course! 
You are in the palace of the [[Tempest]]. 
Look, I do not have time for idle chatter with strangers. 
Push off, before [[Mordea]] has both our heads. 
I must be about my duties anyway. 
[[Oh]], yes, I heard you had a part in ridding us of [[Mordea]]. 
[[Do]] not tell anyone I said this, but, thanks.
