man 
[[Stratos]]! Preserve me! 
What are you doing there...? 
Hello? 
Can I help you? 
Who goes there? 
I can hear your footsteps! 
[[Do]] you require my assistance? 
Very well then... 
Where is that Xavier? 
hmmmm... 
No rest for the weary. 
Brrrr! There is a chill in the air. 
[[Perhaps]]...? 
No, I don't think so... 
[[Oh]] mighty [[Stratos]], forgive my fragility. 
[[Oh]], my aching bones. 
I must meditate! 
I feel refreshed now! 
[[Oh]], well. 
[[Yes]]? 
Who goes there? I feel your presence. 
[[Speak]]! Who is there? 
I must have a talk with the acolytes. 
I must have a talk with [[Torwin]]. 
The flowers smell sweet today. 
Where is that focus? 
Ahh, fresh air. 
[[Oh]], my bones feel tired today. 
Those noisy monks. 
Pardon me, good sir. 
Pardon me. 
[[Welcome]], my friend. 
Hello again, [[Stellos]]. 
bye 
[[Welcome]], stranger. 
[[Good]] day to you. 
Tell me of the Test of Wisdom. 
I have passed the Test of Wisdom. 
What do you know of the Test of Centeredness? 
I have passed the first two tests. 
I have constructed my Foci. 
I passed the Test of Centeredness. 
I have completed the Third Test. 
I have passed the third test. 
I have met [[Torwin]]. 
I have spoken with [[Brother]] Xavier. 
I spoke with [[Holy]] [[Cyrrus]]. 
[[Poor]] [[Torwin]]. 
I have heard the [[Mystic]] [[Voice]]. 
I have the [[Breath]] of Wind. 
I found this ring. 
I need healing. 
[[It]] is good to hear your voice again, friend. 
Who is [[Stratos]]? 
What do you do? 
I am sorry, but I do not have the strength to perform such a service. [[Come]] back later after I have rested. 
[[That]] is certainly no problem. 
[[Please]] leave me now, I need to rest. 
[[And]] a good day to you, my friend. [[How]] may I help you? 
[[By]] what are you called? 
I am [[Stellos]]. I have lived here for many, many years. 
[[How]] many years? 
I am the leader of the [[Order]] of [[Enlightenment]]. 
Leader? 
[[Order]] of [[Enlightenment]] 
Well, it really isn't an official title. [[Most]] of the younger members come to me for guidance because I am the oldest member of the [[Order]]. 
[[That]] is the name of those of us who follow the [[Great]] [[Air]] [[Titan]], [[Stratos]]. 
Through the grace of the [[Great]] [[Air]] [[Titan]], [[Stratos]], I have lived over 200 years. 
200 years! 
[[Stratos]] is the greatest of the [[Titans]], for it is through the power of [[Stratos]] that we of the [[Order]] gain our ability to heal the hurts of the world. [[However]], this gift is not without cost. 
Tell me of healing. 
What is the cost? 
The healing is done by using a [[Focus]] to channel the powers of [[Stratos]] to the patient. This is a delicate procedure for if the healer is not steady in his ability or disciplined in his art, he may reach too deeply into the power and destroy himself and the patient. 
I would like to learn to heal. 
To do that you will have to join the [[Order]]. 
Then I will join your order. 
I am sorry, I cannot join your order. 
The first steps to joining the [[Order]] of [[Enlightenment]] are to pass the [[Tests]] of Wisdom and Centeredness. [[Brother]] Xavier can tell you more. I suggest you seek him out. Of course, I encourage you to spend time speaking to -all- of the [[Theurgists]] here, for every member of our order is likely to have some wisdom which might help you reach enlightenment. 
I'm sorry you are not interested. Should you change your mind, [[Brother]] Xavier is the one to speak to in order to begin your journey down the path to [[Enlightenment]]. 
[[As]] you can see by the clouding in my eyes, I am blind. [[It]] is the price I pay for being able to serve [[Stratos]] so completely. 
[[It]] is a long time for anyone to live. [[Stratos]] must have need for me to keep me here so long. 
Your time studying was well spent then. Until you arrived, I was impressed with [[Torwin]]'s speed, but we've never had a student succeed at the rate you are progressing. [[Stratos]] will be so pleased with you. 
[[Stratos]] will be pleased? 
I commune daily with the Giver of [[Life]]. Recently she has been speaking of one who would come and be the greatest healer [[Argentrock]] [[Isle]] has ever seen. [[She]] described this great healer to me. When [[Torwin]] arrived here, I thought it was he she spoke of, but now I realize it is you. [[Oh]], she has looked forward to your arrival and all the great things you will do as one of her healers! 
I am pleased you have come through it unharmed. [[So]] many times we have lost initiates to it. 
[[Ah]], so you have begun the road to [[Enlightenment]]. [[Stratos]] will be pleased. [[She]] sets great store by you. What do you wish to know? 
Tell me the answers, please. 
Where can I find the answers? 
[[It]] is forbidden for anyone to give away the answers to the Test of Wisdom. The answers you must find for yourself, 
, for they must come from your heart.
You must go to the library in the monastery. There you will find many old texts that discuss at great lengh the philosophy of [[Stratos]]. Read these and apply them to your own feelings. [[Only]] then will you find the right answers. 
What do you know about the Test of Centeredness? 
The Test of Centeredness is an important test as it tests your stamina and courage. Why even our most prized pupil, [[Torwin]], took several tries before he managed to succeed. [[And]] he is one of the lucky ones. We've had many fall to their deaths. 
[[Yes]], I know. You have proven yourself worthy to wear the title Initiate. [[Now]] you are ready to begin learning the spells that [[Stratos]] grants us. [[However]], before you do that, you must construct your Foci. 
What are Foci? 
[[How]] do I construct the Foci? 
[[That]] is wonderful. [[Now]] you must construct your Foci. 
The construction of the Foci is the most important task an Initiate in the [[Order]] of [[Enlightenment]] can undertake. The Foci are wrought of the finest silver, found only in the caverns under our monastery. These caverns are dark and fraught with fearsome creatures. 
Using this key, you will be able to open the door where the silver may be found. 
I would give you the key to the mine, but I see that your hands are full. Maybe later. 
Using the key I gave you earlier, you may use it to unlock the door to the mine. [[After]] you have removed enough silver ore to construct your focuses, please lock the door again. There are more than a few curious souls who have found that mine to be their final resting place, so please seal it when you are done. 
What do I do with the silver? 
You must take the silver to the blacksmith, [[Korick]], in [[Tenebrae]]. [[Only]] he has the skill to forge the Foci. [[But]] these Foci will be without power. You must return here, place them upon the [[Altar]] of [[Focus]] in the monastary and call upon the name of [[Stratos]]. [[If]] you have met with her approval, she will fill them with her power. 
A [[Focus]] is a talisman of great magical power. [[It]] is a channel. [[It]] allows the wielder to touch a small part of the great power of [[Stratos]] and use it for the specific purpose for which the [[Focus]] was designed such as healing. [[It]] is a powerful item, but in the hands of the inexperienced or weak, it can kill. 
Very good. You are well on your way to becoming a full [[Adept]]. The next step is a test of all you have learned. You must return to the caverns under the monastery. You will know what to do when you arrive there. 
[[That]] is a wonderful thing! 
[[That]] is a wonderful thing. [[However]], you will have to excuse me. I do not have the time to further your education. We have had a terrible thing happen. 
What has happened? 
[[Brother]] Xavier has lost his [[Focus]] of healing. 
[[How]] did that happen? 
No one is sure. [[Poor]] [[Brother]] Xavier is beside himself with grief. [[It]] is very unlikely that an [[Adept]] would simply misplace something like that. [[Ah]] well, if he knows more, he is not telling me. 
[[Do]] you think it was stolen? 
[[It]] wounds me deeply to think that one of our own would stoop so low as to steal from another enlightened one. [[It]] goes against all of [[Stratos]]' teachings. [[But]], she also teaches mercy and compassion, so if it was stolen by one of our own, I will not hold it against that person, but rather, will help him find the path of [[Enlightenment]] again. 
I was saddened to learn of his tragedy. 
[[He]] is one of our newest Initiates. [[He]] has shown tremendous progress. Until you, he was the finest student we had ever trained. Recently he was been doing some interesting research. 
What research is [[Torwin]] doing? 
[[One]] of your finest? 
[[He]] has been looking into the possibility of combining Foci to increase their power. Although I don't believe there is much chance, I don't like to stifle creativity and individuality. 
Certainly. [[He]] finished the Test of Wisdom in record time. [[He]] also successfully completed the Test of Centeredness with virtually no mishaps. We have been very proud of him. 
[[He]] is such a fine man, and such a wonderful healer. [[His]] brusque manner has put some people off at times, but he really is a kind man at heart. 
[[Good]] [[Cyrrus]]. [[He]] is such a kind and gentle soul. [[In]] the beginning I was not sure he would be able to withstand the rigors of life here on [[Argentrock]]. [[But]] he has a core of iron, he does. [[He]] is truly a joy to work with. 
Loss of life is always a tragedy, however, the loss of one so gifted is even a greater loss for those who will not receive his healing powers. [[However]], I am glad the [[Focus]] was found. You have plainly shown yourself to be ready to pass the final test and become a full [[Adept]]. 
[[Poor]] [[Torwin]] 
[[Adept]]? 
Final test? 
[[Yes]]. When you become an [[Adept]], you will have full use of all the spells [[Stratos]] gives her followers. 
[[In]] the final test there are no creatures for you to fight, no riddles to answer nor problems to solve. There is simply you and your belief. You must rely upon your own ability and your faith in [[Stratos]]' power. 
[[How]] do I take this test? 
You must travel to [[Windy]] [[Point]] where you will find two black pillars. Stand between those pillars. [[If]] you truly wish to hear the [[Mystic]] [[Voice]], you must then take a leap of faith. 
Then you are truly an [[Adept]]. Your work and dedication have made it possible for you to reach enlightenment in less time than it has taken any other. You have done quite well. 
What do you know of the [[Breath]] of Wind? 
[[Ah]], the [[Breath]] of Wind is that through which [[Stratos]] gives her power to her chosen children. Why do you ask? 
I must have it. 
I was just curious. 
[[Ah]], it is good for a Child of [[Stratos]] to seek knowledge. Continue on the path and you will soon gain the wisdom you seek. 
[[Ah]], I was afraid it would come to this. The [[Breath]] of Wind is found with [[Stratos]]. Although you will find it with [[Stratos]], you cannot see it with only your eyes. There are many ways to see things. 
You are to be congratulated, for you have achieved that which no other has. You will have to excuse me, however, if I seem to lack some enthusiasm at your accomplishment. 
Why are you lacking enthusiasm? 
No other has done this? 
Taking the [[Breath]] of Wind is not without repercussion. 
What repercussions? 
[[Even]] I have not dared such a feat. You are truly one of unparalleled character and bravery. 
I understand you are doing what must be done, however, without the [[Breath]] of Wind to draw from, we of Argent Rock will be without our healing spells. [[So]], I hope that you know what you do, for if you are in error, the entire population will suffer. [[As]] will I. 
Why will you suffer? 
Here let me feel it. 
[[Ah]], yes. This is [[Torwin]]'s. [[It]] is not very valuable, but he was very proud of it. [[He]] said it belonged to his father. I am afraid it is all that is left of poor [[Torwin]]. This must be returned to his mother. You will return it, won't you? 
[[Yes]], I will. 
No, I won't. 
[[Ah]], there is a good fellow. [[Stratos]] was right in trusting you. 
[[But]] you found it and were the last to see [[Torwin]] alive. [[It]] is your duty, nay, your honor to take it to his mother. Won't you? 
I said no! 
[[It]] seems then, that I've severly misjudged you. 
[[It]] was with the power of [[Stratos]] that I was able to stay alive. [[Now]] that the link has been severed, I will no longer receive those blessings which prolong my life. [[Even]] now, I feel the years creeping up on me. I am afraid I can last no longer. Goodbye, my friend, use the power well, for it comes at great cost. 
May you be well.
