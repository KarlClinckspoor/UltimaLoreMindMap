guardsman 
Stop! Thief! 
Guardsman! 
Now what...? 
What do you want...? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
goodbye 
Who are you to ask me such? 
'Tis I who should demand your name, cur! 
My job is to guard to watch out for odds folks like you. 
You are in the palace, of course! 
What makes you think I have time for this kind of talk? 
Continue on your way before I decide to put you away. 
About time.
