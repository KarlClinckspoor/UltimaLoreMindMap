THE ART OF FLAME  
by [[Maedron]], [[First]] [[Acolyte]] of the [[Cabal]]  
  
[[Fire]] is the crucible of [[Life]]. [[Before]] it, all impurities are burned away. All that remains is a pure, unclouded will. A [[Sorcerer]] should revel in this and know that power is his servant. The will of the [[Sorcerer]] is the crucible of the reagents. [[But]] I speak herein not of the reagents, but instead, of the foci of [[Sorcery]].  
  
The first focus we [[Sorcerers]] created was made by casting a metal disk with shavings of a black, rock-like substance. This substance was found to be throughout the island, and in fact, all of our foci use this substance, to a greater or lesser degree. The disk was then engraved with the pentagram, symbol of [[Fire]]. This dedicates it to our purposes. No [[Sorcerer]] should be without his symbol, as it is the outward token of our superiority. A note about the [[Sorcerer]]'s pentagram symbol: [[It]] may cast several of the [[Ignite]] or [[Extinguish]] cantrips. Any other power, it may cast but once.  
  
The symbol, while versatile, lacked power. [[So]] we crafted a wand. [[It]] was only stable with less of the blackrock, but a gem from the core of the volcano gave it the power necessary. These [[Fire]] gems focused the will of the [[Sorcerer]]'s own inner [[Fire]]. [[Casting]] capacity of the [[Sorcerer]]'s wand: [[It]] has the power to focus the [[Ignite]] and [[Extinguish]] spells in quantity, as well as the [[Flash]] and [[Flame]] [[Bolt]] spells to a slightly lesser degree.  
  
[[In]] attempt to further increase the prowess of our spells, we created a rod, suffused with blackrock, with a [[Fire]] gem at either end, as well as the center. This focus allowed the casting of spells of defensive nature, in addition to those of the wand. [[Casting]] capacity of the [[Sorcerer]]'s rod: This focus can cast the wand spells in greater measure, and is empowered to cast the [[Endure]] [[Heat]], [[Fire]] [[Shield]], and [[Armor]] of [[Flames]] spells.  
  
[[Master]] [[Corodin]], continued upon the work of the others by making another focus in a similar vein. [[It]] is formed mostly of solid blackrock, fused into the shape of a staff by the power of [[Pyros]]. [[At]] either end, it holds a [[Fire]] gem, capped within blackrock metal. [[Casting]] capacity of the [[Master]]'s [[Staff]]: [[Unknown]], but it can cast create [[Fire]] and cause explosions as well.  
  
I myself, becoming consumed with the idea that a more efficient, more powerful focus was possible, crafted the most powerful focus of all. Using the bones of [[Pyros]]' daemonic servants, I made a fine powder. Then, mixing this powder with clay and the blood said deamon, I fashioned a small replica of its skull. With [[Fire]] gems as its eyes, and baked in the heat of lava, it hardened to the strength of good masonry. With this talisman, I was able to summon daemons to do my bidding, and banish them with mere words. The wielder of this focus should truly be considered the [[Master]] of the [[Enclave]].
