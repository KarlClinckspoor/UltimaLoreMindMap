[[By]] [[Okapi]] the [[Elder]]  
  
[[It]] is oft said that there is no other material as precious as gold. [[Perhaps]] one reason that we feel this way is that it gleams and shines like the sun that rises to greet us every morn. [[However]], this is not the only reason we value gold so much. [[Indeed]], there are several reasons other than its beauty that makes it so worthy of praise. [[Its]] malleability, conductivity and resistance to corrosion are among the chief reasons we adore this metal. [[One]] very reliable method of extracting this ore from the land is mining. This requires the digging of long, often deep and dangerous shafts within the land. This is often accompanied by the use of explosives that ease the difficulties associated with the removal process.  
  
[[Another]] method, although not as high-yielding as mining, but much safer, is panning. Panning is done with a shallow pan, and requires, more than anything, patience. [[Many]] of the area streams and brooks abound with gold nuggets and dust, and by filling the pan with silt and washing the silt from the pan, one will find only the heaviest of objects left. [[And]], with the gentile graces of [[Amoras]], those heaviest of objects will turn out to be gold. The process is time consuming, but relaxing and profitable. Gold has enjoyed a popularity that no other mineral ever has, and will most likely continue to be highly valuable.  
  
[[Besides]] being the basis for our monetary system, it can be found in jewelry and sculpture, and used for filling decaying teeth, and even as everyday plaques.
