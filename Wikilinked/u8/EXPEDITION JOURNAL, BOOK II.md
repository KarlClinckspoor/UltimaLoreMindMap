[[Day]] [[Seventeen]]... [[It]]'s been about four days since [[Salem]] received the fatal blow, and some strange events have happened. Three children entered the camp before midnight, claiming to be childhood friends of his. When she saw them, [[Iane]] let out a fearsome scream and collapsed, and the little strangers made a hasty retreat into the night. [[How]] could children be childhood friends of a man in his late thirties?  
  
[[Day]] [[Eighteen]]... This morning around breakfast, [[Iane]] explained that the childhood companions were only illusions that [[Salem]] used to create to entertain himself, and if the illusions still existed, then [[Salem]] must still be alive. We will seek advice when we return to [[Tenebrae]].  
  
[[Day]] [[Nineteen]]... [[After]] a rugged day of travel yesterday, we all expected a much needed and well deserved rest in [[Tenebrae]], but it was not to be. [[As]] soon as the door to our leased cabin was opened, those three children were lurking about inside. Still they pleaded for us to rescue [[Salem]], and we had decided to let them stay with us and investigate their claims in the morning. The fact that they knew our destination before we did unnerves me to no end. There was no sleep to be had with the mournful gaze of the oldest child (who calls himself [[Collin]]) watching me all night.  
  
[[Day]] Twenty... Today we went on a wild chase with the fire brigade as they attempted to douse several fires that started simultaneously around [[Tenebrae]] when a shower of flaming stones rained from the sky. Ianes skirts caught fire, and she raised quite a stir when she lept into the [[Tempest]]'s fountain to douse them, and discovered it was stocked with snapping eels!  
  
[[Day]] Twenty-[[One]]... We have spent the day on the road, following the directions of [[Collin]]. [[He]] has offered no information about [[Salem]]'s condition other than he needs help. [[After]] what I saw happen to him, there is no way he could be alive. What kind of help does a dead person need? I guess we will find out tomorrow.  
  
[[Day]] Twenty-Two... The black shadow of the keep still falls over us as the sun rises on the other side. The silence and cold here is not natural, and [[Warwick]] is convinced we are being watched from the twisted spires. I am going to carry my speaking stone into the place, and it will recognize [[Salem]] without error.
