dead guardsman 
guardsman 
Guardsman! 
The [[Titans]] are seeking revenge! We are doomed! 
The very earth shakes and spits up the dead! We must repent for whatever misdeed we have commmitted. 
Why is it always -me- you bother? 
What can I do for you? 
Stop with the questions already. 
What do you want, stranger? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
Bye 
Why do you want to know? 
Only mindless twits go around asking every stranger they meet their name. 
I watch over the new [[Tempest]], [[Devon]], of course. 
I watch over her Ladyship [[Mordea]], of course! 
You are in the palace and home to the [[Tempest]]. 
Go ask someone who wants to help you. 
To you too. 
If it is true what I heard -- that you had a part in deposing [[Mordea]] -- let me offer my thanks.
