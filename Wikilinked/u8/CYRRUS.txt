the late [[Cyrrus]] 
[[Holy]] [[Cyrrus]], the healer 
[[Cyrrus]]
monk 
man 
Aid me, [[Stratos]]! 
What are you doing there...? 
I must meditate! 
I feel refreshed now! 
Why are you still here? 
Why are you here, stranger? 
[[Please]], I'd like my privacy. 
Are you here to rob me?! 
[[Please]], I need to be alone. 
What are you doing here? 
May I help you with something? 
I wonder if [[Torwin]] has supper plans? 
Gee, I miss [[Torwin]]. 
Hmmmm... 
I need to return to my studies. 
[[Perhaps]] I should travel home to [[Tenebrae]]. 
Then I could visit my true love, Jenna. 
Curse these shoes. 
I should tend to the garden. 
[[It]] is rather humid today. 
[[Do]] you require my assistance? 
What do you need here, stranger? 
What do you require? 
[[Yes]], stranger? 
[[Yes]]? 
I need to speak to the others. 
I need to speak to [[Torwin]]. 
Mmmmm 
I'm feeling a bit peckish. 
I should leave for [[Tenebrae]] soon. 
[[Blast]] these bunions. 
I must remember to prune the garden. 
[[Let]] me see... 
No, that's not it. 
Are you lost? 
[[Is]] it not lovely here? 
[[Do]] you want something, my friend? 
Hello, stranger! 
[[Do]] you need something? 
This is lovely, but I do miss [[Tenebrae]]. 
Are you in need? 
I wish Jenna were here. 
I wish I were in [[Tenebrae]]. 
[[Ouch]]! 
Curse these insects! 
I should have brought my cloak. 
Hummm, no birds today. 
The clouds are turning grey... 
I think it's going to rain. 
Pardon me. 
Hello, [[Cyrrus]]. 
Hello. 
I need healing. 
[[Have]] you passed the Test of Wisdom? 
[[Is]] the Test of Centeredness difficult? 
I have passed the [[Tests]] of Wisdom and Centeredness. 
I passed the Third Test. 
I have passed the Third Test and have my Foci. 
[[Have]] you seen [[Torwin]]? 
I have heard the [[Mystic]] [[Voice]]. 
I found this ring. 
I have the [[Breath]] of Wind. 
[[Good]] day to you. 
bye 
[[Welcome]] to our island. 
[[By]] what are you called? 
What place is this? 
[[Ah]], hello my friend. I am pleased to see you. 
Where are you from? 
I am called [[Holy]] [[Cyrrus]] but please, just call me [[Cyrrus]]. 
[[Holy]] [[Cyrrus]]? 
[[That]] is marvelous! You must be very excited. [[It]] is too bad that [[Torwin]] could not be here to share in your triumph... 
I am sorry, but I do not have the strength to perform such a service. [[Come]] back later after I have rested. 
[[That]] is certainly no problem. 
[[Please]] leave me now, I need to rest. 
For certes. [[It]] is only the first step on the road to [[Enlightenment]]. [[It]] was not easy by any means. 
Will you tell me the answers? 
Where did you get the answers? 
The Test of Centeredness was difficult? 
Difficult? [[It]] was nearly the death of me! I fell at least five times. Fortunately [[Stratos]] saw fit to keep me and not send me to my death over the steep side. [[But]], you'll see for yourself when you get there! 
You have? [[But]] you've just arrived on our island. I don't believe we've ever had anyone complete them this fast. [[Stratos]] will be so pleased with your accomplishments. [[Now]] you must find [[Stellos]] and begin on the next part of your journey. 
[[That]] is wonderful! You must be quite excited. 
I am sorry I can not celebrate with you, but a terrible thing has happened. [[Brother]] Xavier has lost one of his Foci. 
[[How]] did it happen? 
[[It]] seems it was taken while he slept. I am sorry but I must be going. I have to help look for the missing [[Focus]]. 
Why, no. [[And]], may I add, what a cruel thing to ask! 
No I have not. (yes I have) 
Why are you covering up for him? 
Where is he? 
No, I haven't seen him all day. 
I do not know. ([[He]] told me he was going to go to [[Windy]] [[Point]] today for something very important.) 
I do not know. 
I am not covering for him! (I think he is the one who took the [[Focus]]. I don't think he meant any harm by it, though. [[He]] is not a mean-spirited person) 
Pardon me? I am not covering up for him. [[That]] would go against all the teachings of [[Stratos]]. 
[[That]] is the name given to me by [[Stellos]]. [[Everyone]] thinks it is a grand name. 
[[It]] is a grand name. 
[[Everyone]]? 
I am sure my father has bragged about it to everyone, including the torax! 
Your father is a herdsman? 
[[My]] mother and father, the others here... why, just everyone. 
[[Yes]], and so I would be. [[It]]'s birthing time back home. [[My]] favorite time of the year. Watching the beginning of a new life, helping that new life to stand... aahhh, it is one of greatest joys in my life. [[But]] that is all behind me now. 
[[My]] home is in the hills of [[Tenebrae]]. [[Even]] Argent Rock with all its finery is but a pale shadow of the beauty of [[Tenebrae]]. The ocean, the hills, the people...I miss it so. 
You miss the people of [[Tenebrae]]? 
Why are you here? 
[[It]] was discovered when I was quite young that I had a talent for healing. [[My]] mother and father were so proud. They told everyone about their brilliant child who was going to heal the world. Then my sister was injured by a kith. No matter how I tried, my meager skills were no match for her injury. [[She]] died and I vowed it would never happen again. I left home and made my way here. I've been here ever since. 
[[It]] has been my home since birth. I miss the people. [[Darion]] with all his bluff and bluster, used to carry candy in his pocket for me. [[Bentic]] tutored both Jenna and I when we were young. [[Oh]], my beloved Jenna. I try not to think of her, it pains me so. 
Tell me of Jenna. 
Tell me of [[Darion]]. 
[[Bentic]] is dead. 
Tell me of [[Bentic]]. 
I miss him so. [[He]] is a kind and gentle man who's greatest loves in life are his books and his studies. [[He]] knows so much about so many things, he is fascinating to talk with. 
[[He]] talked of the day I would join the guard. I told him many times I would be a herdsman like my father. 'Nonsense,' he would say, 'you're cut out to be a guard, you have the spirit for it.' I don't know why, the guard never does anything but hang around the castle hoping [[Aramina]] will bring them a sweet from the [[Tempest]]'s table! [[He]] is Jenna's father, you know. 
Jenna's father? 
[[Yes]], and in my fondest dreams, he was to be my father- in-law, for I love Jenna so. 
[[Oh]] no! Say it is not so! [[Oh]] dear! You bring me sad news of my home! Pray, how did this happen? 
[[Mordea]] had him executed. 
I know not 
'Tis a sad day for me. [[Bentic]] was a dear friend. 
The [[Tempest]]? I knew she was a hard woman, but to execute someone as gentle and harmless as [[Bentic]]? What terrible thing did he do that would anger the [[Tempest]] so? 
[[He]] conducted forbidden research. 
I do not know 
I cannot imagine what terrible wrong [[Bentic]] committed that would result in his death. [[He]] was a kind and good man. 
Research was what [[Bentic]] loved most. [[Ah]], 'tis a sad day when good folks are executed for doing something which they love and brings harm to no one. 
[[Ah]], you've met her, then. Isn't she a lovely creature? I have loved her from the moment I laid eyes on her. I always dreamed she would marry me and live with me in the hills, helping tend the torax. [[It]] is funny how things never work out like we expect. 
[[She]] lives in [[Tenebrae]]. [[If]] you should travel there, stop in and see her. [[She]] is a lovely girl, so full of life. I would that I could marry her, but I cannot. 
Why not marry her? 
Look around you, my friend. There are few enough of us here on Argent Rock. Rare are those with the talent it takes to touch the power of [[Stratos]] and use it to heal. I am one of those few. To help the people of this land I must sacrifice that which I most dearly desire...to marry my beloved Jenna and live a simple herdsman's life in the hills above [[Tenebrae]]. 
This is Argent Rock, home of the [[Theurgists]]. 
Who are the [[Theurgists]]? 
Why we are the disciples of [[Stratos]], the [[Great]] [[Titan]] of [[Air]]. We are healers. 
I have heard. This is certainly a great occasion. [[Now]] you are ready to attempt the greatest feat of your life...to reach out and touch the power that is [[Stratos]]. 
I passed the Third [[Tests]]. 
[[Touch]] [[Stratos]]' power? 
The greatest feat? 
The power that gives us the ability to heal people. [[It]] is a thrilling moment when you first touch the [[Titan]]. Certainly nothing you will ever forget. 
You must go to [[Stellos]]. [[He]] will tell you how to reach [[Stratos]]. 
[[That]] explains it then. I felt a tremor in my link with [[Stratos]], then it was broken. I am unable to heal. 
You are unable to heal? 
I hope that you use the [[Breath]] of Wind for a higher purpose, for it was taken at great sacrifice to the people of this land. [[It]] is a bitter sweet time for me. 
Why bittersweet? 
For if my link with [[Stratos]] is permanently broken then I can never heal the sick and injured of this land again. This would be a tragic thing for the people, however, it also would release me of my vow to [[Stratos]], leaving me free to return to [[Tenebrae]] and marry my beloved Jenna. [[So]] while I mourn for the people, I thank you for giving my love to me. 
Certainly not. [[That]] is an unthinkable thing. You must find the answers yourself as have all those seeking [[Enlightenment]] before you have. 
[[From]] the library. [[Oh]], the hours I spent in there pouring over the old texts until the candle I was using was burned to a nub. [[Yes]], those were difficult days. [[But]] not as difficult as the Test of Centeredness. 
[[My]] goodness. [[That]]'s [[Torwin]]'s ring! [[Oh]] my, it belonged to his father. [[He]] showed it to everyone he met. [[Oh]] how terribly, terribly sad! You should take it to his mother. 
I shall. 
I don't think I will. 
I know she will be very happy. [[It]] is a kind thing you do. Give her my regards, will you? 
[[Perhaps]] you are right. The shock and sadness might be too much for her. Still, I think it would be best to return it to her. 
Goodbye. 
Why is this wide open?
