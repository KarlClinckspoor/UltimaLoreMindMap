SPELLBOOKS OF THAUMATURGY  
  
[[Confusion]] [[Blast]] - [[In]] [[Quas]] [[Wis]]  
With these words the caster releases a wave of etheric emanations that cause all opponents to forget not only the current combat in which they are involved, but also any hostile dispositions towards the caster. The necessary components are the spellbook and the following reagents: [[Eye]] of [[Newt]], [[Bat]] [[Wing]], [[Serpent]] [[Scale]], [[Obsidian]], and [[Brimstone]].  
  
[[Meteor]] [[Shower]] - [[Kal]] [[Des]] [[Flam]] [[Ylem]]  
[[By]] intoning these words the caster calls down from the sky great flaming boulders, as if the material was spewn from the lip of a volcano. The necessary components are the spellbook and the following reagents: [[Ash]], [[Dirt]], [[Serpent]] [[Scale]], [[Brimstone]], and [[Blackmoor]].  
  
[[Summon]] [[Creature]] - [[Kal]] [[Xen]]  
[[Speaking]] these words of power calls a creature to arrive and defend the caster. What creature appears is determined not so much by the caster's wishes, but by the caster's power and the proximity of the summoned creature. The necessary components are the spellbook and the following reagents: [[Bat]] [[Wing]], [[Pumice]], [[Obsidian]], [[Bone]].  
  
[[Call]] [[Destruction]] - [[Kal]] [[Vas]] [[Grav]] [[Por]]  
[[From]] the utterance of these words comes the power to call down from the sky great bolts of lightning which cascade about the caster and strike down his or her foes. [[Note]] that the resultant fiery explosions will unerringly hit visible targets, but will not be able to affect invisible targets. The necessary components are the spellbook and the following reagents: [[Serpent]] [[Scale]], [[Dragon]] [[Blood]], [[Ash]], [[Pig]] [[Iron]], and [[Executioner]]'s [[Hood]].  
  
[[Devastation]] - [[In]] [[Vas]] [[Ort]] [[Corp]]  
Warning... This power contained within the words of this spell render it worthy of its name. The very nature of the energies released is designed to disrupt the very fabric of living existence on a plane, thus annihilating all life save that of the mage who casts this spell. To know this spell, obviously formulated by a violently deranged wizard bent on world domination, is a tremendous responsibility, for invoking the words is a constant temptation for any experimenter. Fortunately, no one who knows the spell has yet shirked that responsibility, as far as I can tell...  
  
The necessary components are the spellbook, a hatred for all things living, and the following reagents: [[Bat]] [[Wing]], [[Serpent]] [[Scale]], [[Dragon]] [[Blood]], [[Pig]] [[Iron]], [[Executioner]]'s [[Hood]], [[Blackmoor]], [[Brimstone]].  
  
[[Ethereal]] [[Travel]] - [[Ort]] [[Grav]] [[Por]]  
[[Invoking]] this powerful ritual permits the caster to traverse the interdimensional realm known as the [[Ether]]. A mage's first few castings of this spell will prove awkward, for inexperienced mages will have difficulty determining their destination. With time, however, the mage will be able to dictate an arrival point and appear there. [[Note]] that this spell should not be confused with a spell of teleportation, for the former permits travel only between dimensions, while the latter permits travel only within a dimension.  
  
The necessary components for this spell are hard to specify, for they seem to change depending on both the casting location and the destination. Usually the components include material native to one or both of the dimensions. [[In]] general, setting five pieces of the material -- no piece smaller than a man's head -- on the ground in the form of a pentacle and concentrating on one of the chunks, all while speaking the words of power, should permit the dimensional gate to transport the caster.[[Note]]: I suspect the material of the initial gate created in the ancient temple of the first [[Pagans]] would suffice while in this dimension, though the location of any of the fragments as well as the destination is a mystery to me. - [[Mythran]]
