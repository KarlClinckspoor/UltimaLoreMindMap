A LETTER TO NEW ACOLYTES  
  
Dear New [[Acolyte]]: It is with great gladness I welcome you to the family of [[Stratos]]. She has welcomed you home and has given you the greatest power of all, the power to heal. This gift is not without price, however, and it is important that you learn the responsibilites that come with the power. The first lesson you must learn is the lesson of impartiality. The gift of healing is given to all who need it, without favoritism, malice, or greed. Should you come across a battle field, your first duty is to the injured. If you hesitate even one moment, even to see the outcome of the battle or determine which side is 'correct', then you are failing in your calling as an [[Acolyte]] of [[Stratos]].  
  
While there is great joy in the gift of healing, there can also be great cost. For to bring a life back from the edge of the [[Pit of Death]] will cost you more than your energy, or a spell of healing. [[Stratos]] will give you the power to restore life, but you, in turn, must give her your sight. This is the greatest cost, but I think it is a fair one, for what value does a single sense hold when compared to whole of the body and spirit. All these things you must keep close to you heart, for you are about to embark upon one of the most fulfilling callings known, an [[Acolyte]] of [[Stratos]]. - [[Stellos]]
