[[Mordea]] the [[Tempest]] 
[[Mordea]]
[[Tempest]] 
woman 
Playing with my food, eh? 
You need to be taught some manners! 
I saw you with that key! 
[[Do]] not touch that! 
Beren! I am assaulted! 
You will pay for that! 
Imbecile! [[Do]] you wish to join [[Toran]]? Get out of my way! 
Greetings! 
Greetings, your Ladyship! 
Are you speaking to me? 
[[Yes]], I am. 
bye 
[[Oh]], no. 'Tis you again... 
Greeting's again. 
[[How]] can I help you, 
?
May I speak with you? 
I am 
.
Who are you that you dare address the [[Tempest]]? 
[[That]] is not your concern. 
Who are you? 
[[Tempest]]? 
Tell me of the [[Tempestry]]. 
I know not your name nor your face. I think you are not from [[Tenebrae]]. Where are you from? 
I am from [[Britannia]]. 
I am from [[Earth]]. 
I am from far away. 
I am from [[Tenebrae]]. 
You are a liar. I know all my subjects...and they know me. I will not tolerate such impudence. 
Know you not of the [[Tempestry]] and its great power? [[Perhaps]], then you should like a taste of it. -When I feed you to the [[Lurker]]!- 
I am not familiar with your name or your face. I think you are not from [[Tenebrae]]. Where are you from? 
[[By]] what are you called? 
I've never heard of such a place. You are either a liar or a fool. You don't look smart enough to be a liar and I will not tolerate a fool. 
Fool! I am the [[Lady]] [[Mordea]], the [[Tempest]] of [[Tenebrae]]. You will use reverence when dealing with me in the future or I shall have you thrown to the [[Lurker]]! 
Knave! Keep a civil tongue in your head or I shall have it cut out and fed to the fishes! 
[[Do]] not toy with me, rogue. I will not tolerate such rudeness. Begone from my sight. 
[[Earth]]? What sort of nonsense is this? A place called [[Earth]]? There is no such place by that name. You are nothing more than a simpleminded fool. Begone. 
Waste not my time! 
I have better things to do... 
Leave me now. 
Begone! I wish to be alone. 
What an ugly painting! 
Away from there! 
Where's the butter? 
[[Aramina]], my cup is empty! 
Who cooked this slop? 
Too much salt! 
The torax is undercooked! 
Hey! People are starving here! 
[[My]] plate is empty! 
I need a plate! 
I can not eat off the table! 
Off with his head! 
Feed them all to the [[Lurker]]! 
[[More]] executions! 
Flog the peasants! 
[[More]] work for less pay! 
Double the taxes! 
No more days of rest! 
You are correct! 
[[Yes]]! [[Yes]]! 
You are so generous! 
I will attend to it! 
[[Yes]], your Ladyship! 
Pure genius! 
I agree completely!
