The Forgotten Riches of [[Knarl]]  
Some say it is an island, while others swear that it deep within the earth. All agree though that the way to [[Knarl]] lies somewhere within the lower catacombs, though the way was lost due to a great earthquake. Many generations ago, back before the sun circled over head, there was a passage that led to this place. Traders flocked to and fro, for this was a place of great wealth. It is said the great weapon forges of [[Knarl]] created many of the magical weapons that we have today, explaining why we have very few in these times.  
  
Other riches lie in the forms of spells. [[Knarl]] was known to have had a great library in which many of the great spellcasters of the day went to study and record their findings. Some say that the magethief Vermin and the enchanter [[Varkus]] studied there in their youth. Some say it was not an earthquake what shut the passage from our world to [[Knarl]], but that it was sealed by magic! There is rumor that a sect was forming at the library, a sect of monks known as the Dark Brothers. It is said that these monks wished to keep the secrets and the treasures of [[Knarl]] to themselves.  
  
Though this is only a rumor, many of the old books and the tales handed down from father to son mention 'the Brother's Below.' Is this a reference to the Dark Brothers?It is said that the way to this magical place lies deep within the heart of the Catacombs. Only there will you find the way to both riches, glory, and power. For he who is of sound heart and of steady sword will be the one to find the passage to [[Knarl]].
