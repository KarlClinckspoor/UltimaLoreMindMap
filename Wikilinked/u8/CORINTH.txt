[[Corinth]] 
Woman 
I would not do that if I were you! 
Stop! Thief! 
Hello. 
I -do- wish that we had a larger house. 
[[Oh]] how I miss my baby boy. 
[[Do]] you need something? 
Very well then... 
We must clean up this house. 
I wonder what [[Cyrrus]] is doing right now? 
No rats! 
Mmmm, kith fillets! 
I truly despise rats! 
I need some kith milk. 
I certainly am glad that a kith did not devour [[Cyrrus]]. 
All day long, all I see are torax. 
I wonder what the people in [[Tenebrae]] are doing? 
No rats! NO RATS!! 
I hope that no kiths come around. 
I need some variety in my life. 
I wish that Gwillim were more sensitive to my needs. 
Greetings 
I'm called 
.
I -do- apologize, my lady. 
Don't turn away from me, woman! 
Hello, [[Corinth]]. 
Hello, stranger. 
I hope I'm not intruding. 
Goodbye. 
Pardon me, sir, but I ask that you treat me with a bit more respect here upon my own land. 
I apologize, m'lady. 
Quiet, woman! 
Apology accepted, sir. I hope that I was not too terse in my response. We certainly do not get many strangers up here. Allow me to introduce my self; I am [[Corinth]]. [[By]] what are you called? 
I would rather not say. 
What? I cannot believe how rude you are! Go away before I call the [[Tenebrae]] guards!! 
Well, I am pleased to meet you, 
. You are welcome here.
[[So]], you don't see many strangers? 
[[Corinth]]? 
What do you do? 
Very well, I shall not pry. 
I will not tolerate such rudeness. Get off of my land, now! 
I was named for my mother who did not survive my birth. Father wished to preserve her memory by naming me after her. 
Father 
Mother 
[[Did]] you not hear me? I said that my mother is dead. 
Lleu was my father but he is dead now. Lleu was a fine herdsman but his devotion to his herd cost him dearly. 
[[He]] was a herdsman? 
Cost him? 
Lleu 
[[Yes]], Lleu, it's an old name. [[It]] is rarely used today. [[In]] many ways my father's name suited him well. 
Suited him? 
old name 
[[My]] father was an old fashioned man with old fashioned values. 
Old values, huh? 
Well I don't mean to say that we don't have values today. I certainly don't want you to get the impression that I'm not happy with our people's values. 
our people's values 
Very well, sir, I accept your apology. I am called [[Corinth]]. [[By]] what are you called? 
Well, hello, my friend. I hope that all is well with you. 
[[It]] is a very old name. [[But]] it's not a [[Zealan]] name. 
[[Zealan]] name? 
[[That]] is what I was told. Actually, I know nothing about the [[Zealans]]. 
Who are the [[Zealans]]? 
All I know of them are but dim memories of stories that I was told as a child. Supposedly there were a race of people that once lived here on [[Pagan]] who were quite savage. [[My]] father used to tell me that if I did not behave, the [[Zealans]] would come and get me. Anyway, that is all that I know of the [[Zealans]]. 
[[Lady]] [[Mordea]] has given us a culture to be proud of. [[Life]] is certainly better today than in the past. 
the past 
[[Her]] Ladyship has given us peace and order. I am happy with that. 
Lleu was a herdsman from the time that he was a boy. [[It]] was all that he knew. 
[[Yes]], long ago Lleu's herd was attacked by a kith. The kith killed Lleu. 
No, you are welcome here. Although you did alarm me a bit. We do no get many strangers up here. Still, it is not for simple folk to say where and when -you- travel. 
[[Do]] you know who I am? 
Well, to be honest, no. [[But]], someone of my stature certainly has no business telling a warrior what he can or can not do. [[But]] I have not introduced myself. I am [[Corinth]]. [[And]] by what are you called? 
I prefer not to say. 
Well met, 
. [[It]] is good to know you.
Very well, I am sure that you have your reasons for your secrecy. 
You think I'm a warrior? 
[[Come]] now, do not be modest. You have the obvious look of a warrior. Look how you are dressed! I may live in the country, but I am not stupid. 
[[As]] we live in the country, away from most people, I do many things. Since my son did move away I am not as busy as I once was. 
[[Many]] things 
Your son? 
I take care of my husband, feed him, stitch his clothes and such. I also keep the house and help tend the torax from time to time. 
Your husband? 
Torax? 
[[My]] dear [[Cyrrus]]. I am so proud of him. [[His]] father and I are but simple people. [[But]] [[Cyrrus]] will do great things. 
[[His]] father? 
[[Great]] things? 
Simple folk. 
[[That]] would be my husband, Gwillim. 
Look about you, my lord. Does this look like the home of a wealthy family? Ours are not easy lives, yet we are proud people. [[Not]] many can do what we do. [[And]] our family has lived in this valley and worked the land for generations. 
You've been here for generations? 
[[Oh]] yes. There used to be a great many families that lived in the valley. [[But]] that was long ago. [[Now]], only Gwillim and I are left to keep the legacy of the valley alive. 
Legacy? 
What happened to the others? 
[[Yes]], we are the only folk that are left who know the myths and legends of the valley. [[It]] is sad, but we are the only people left who care of such things. 
No one cares? 
There is no one -left- to care. Roam this valley all that you wish and the only people that you will see are Gwillim and myself. 
Well, there was a great war long, long ago. [[That]] was the beginning of the end, I suppose. Since that time, many people believed that the land was cursed. [[Many]] people died and many others moved away. 
Cursed? [[By]] a ghost, perhaps? 
Cursed? 
Where did the people move? 
Well that is what some folk believe, but Gwillim and I... [[That]] is to say, ahh... [[Some]] people believe that the land is cursed. [[It]] is best left at that. 
[[My]] father says that most of them moved to the city. 
This was before your time? 
The city? You're kidding! 
No, I am quite serious. The city, like the valley has suffered much and many people have died. 
[[Oh]] yes, it was long ago. I have only heard stories. [[By]] the time I was born, there were only two families here in the valley, mine and Gwillim's. 
What about when you go? 
[[And]] Gwillim's family? 
[[Oh]], they too died off. Gwillim's only brother died rather tragically, and his parents eventually died of age. 
[[How]] did he die? 
[[Yes]]! [[How]] did you know that? 
I have heard tales. 
Can you tell me of the ghost? 
[[It]] is sad, but I fear that when Gwillim and I are gone, then gone too shall be this way of life. I blame myself for it. 
[[That]] is sad, indeed. 
You blame -yourself-? 
I suppose that is the way of things. [[But]] still, I can not help but cry when I think of it. 
[[Oh]], please forget that ever I said such a thing. I need not trouble someone who is a virtual stranger with talk such as this. I have rattled on for far too long as it is. 
This is no trouble. 
[[How]] could you blame yourself? 
I thank you. You are kind to say so. 
Well, there was an accident many years ago... You see, [[Cyrrus]] was not our only child. [[Oh]] dear, I can not believe that I am telling you all of this. 
[[It]]'s ok, go on. 
Stop if you wish. 
No, I will continue. For some reason it feels good to tell this to someone. I had a child after [[Cyrrus]], a baby girl. [[One]] day while the baby was still very young, I went into the barn to fetch a pail. I was only gone but for a moment, but while I was out of the house, a kith did come into the house and devour my baby. 
[[How]] tragic! 
[[Yes]], I shall. You see, when [[Cyrrus]] was still young, I gave birth to a baby girl. [[One]] day while the baby was still very young, I went into the barn to fetch a pale. I was only gone but for a moment, but while I was out of the house, a kith did come into the house and devour my baby. 
For years I have carried the shame and guilt of knowing that I was responsible for my baby's death. Gwillim has always been very kind and supportive. [[He]] tried to tell me that it was not my fault, yet always will have to live with this sadness. 
Strange. I had no idea that such tales have stretched very far. 
Well, I have not seen the ghost myself. I have only heard stories. [[However]], Gwillim, my husband, has seen the creature, but he is very reluctant to talk about it. 
Gwillim's seen the ghost? 
Why is he reluctant to talk? 
[[Yes]], twice, and it was long ago. The first time was when he and his brother were young men. They where watching over their herd when upon the hillside they saw a glowing form above them. 
What about the second time? 
They both saw it? 
The second time, the ghost was actually on the ground, in front of Gwillim. [[He]] said that the ghost appeared to dance around him, as though it was mocking Gwillim. [[He]] also said that it looked most unusual for a ghost. 
Where was it the second time? 
[[It]] looked unusual? 
[[Indeed]] they did. [[From]] that time on, Karpese, that was Gwillim's brother was obsessed with capturing the ghost. 
Gwillim was frightened very deeply by what he saw. [[He]] is a strong man and does not scare easily. Whatever Gwillim saw did disturb him deeply and brings back memories of his brother. Therefore Gwillim does not like to speak of the ghost. 
[[Yes]]. Anyone who has had the misfortune to have visited the graveyard has probably seen a ghost floating in the distance. [[It]] is not unusual to see something such as that in a place where there is nothing but death. [[But]] Gwillim told me that the ghost that haunts this valley is different. 
[[How]] is it different? 
Well, most ghosts that people have seen are vaporous in appearance. [[According]] to Gwillim, this ghost here is invisible except for the armor which it bears. [[It]] is most unusual. 
I am not certain. Gwillim could tell you if you can get him to speak of the ghost. 
[[He]] went searching for the ghost and did never return. 
[[Yes]], the animals that you will see grazing here in the valley. [[Do]] not tell me that you have never heard of a torax. We have been trying to increase the size of our herd so that we can save a little bit more money. 
Save money? 
[[Yes]], it is difficult to do because we don't have very much. Sometimes my husband hunts kiths to bring in extra food. 
[[He]] hunts kiths? 
[[Kith]] meat is very tasty but they are dangerous animals. [[It]] is said that a kith can cut a man in half with its jaws. 
[[That]] sounds dangerous. 
[[Not]] many people hunt them. [[But]] Gwillim is very good at it. 
Gwillim is my husband. [[He]] is a strong and goodly man. 
Strong and goodly? 
[[Many]] men drink every night and beat their wives but Gwillim does not do such things. [[He]] does not even mind that I sacrifice to [[Hydros]]. 
You sacrifice to [[Hydros]]? 
Gwillim is a farmer, so he sacrifices to [[Lithos]], the [[Earth]] [[Titan]]. [[But]], like my father, I sacrifice to the [[Water]] [[Titan]], [[Hydros]]. 
Why [[Hydros]]? 
[[My]] father taught me to sacrifice to [[Hydros]]. All of my family has sacrificed to the [[Lurker]] for as far back as any can remember. 
[[Yes]]! [[Cyrrus]] has gone to study with the [[Theurgists]]. [[He]] will help many people as a [[Theurgist]]. 
[[Theurgist]] 
Help people? 
The [[Theurgists]] are the disciples of the [[Air]] [[Titan]]. Although Gwillim sacrifices to [[Lithos]], I believe that [[Cyrrus]] was born to be a [[Theurgist]]. 
[[But]] what of [[Hydros]]? 
Born to be a [[Theurgist]]? 
The [[Theurgists]] specialize in healing the sick. [[Some]] say that they can even bring back the dead. 
All of the [[Titans]] are worthy of service. Gwillim did not much like the idea of [[Cyrrus]] being a [[Theurgist]] but saw the boy's dedication. [[If]] [[Cyrrus]] is meant to serve [[Stratos]] then we must not stand in his way. 
All of the [[Titans]] are worthy? 
[[By]] that, I mean that all of the [[Titans]] are great powers. I do not mean to say that all are not worthy of good people's service. I would not claim that [[Pyros]] and his sorcerers are worthy of such. 
[[Sorcerers]]? 
All of his life [[Cyrrus]] has most enjoyed caring for others. [[He]] has always a talent for healing. [[It]] did not matter if it was a person or an animal, [[Cyrrus]] would heal it if it were sick. I knew that he was born to be a [[Theurgist]], not to spend his life on a farm. 
[[Even]] animals? 
[[Not]] at the farm 
Ask me nothing of them. [[It]] is ill business to speak of the sorcerers. 
Gwillim wanted very much for [[Cyrrus]] to follow in his footsteps at the farm. I convinced [[Cyrrus]] that his future was more important than his father's traditions. 
[[His]] future? 
[[His]] father's tradition. 
All of Gwillim's kin have always been herdsmen. Gwillim takes great pride in working the land. [[As]] [[Cyrrus]] is our only son, Gwillim expected [[Cyrrus]] to carry on the family's traditions. 
We rarely have visitors here in the country.	We do see that strange old hermit once in a while, though. 
What hermit? 
I believe that his name is [[Mythran]]. [[He]] goes into [[Tenebrae]] now and then, for supplies I suppose. No one knows much about [[Mythran]] but there are many tales about him. 
What kinds of tales? 
[[Oh]] I don't not know them all. People claim that he knows magic. [[Some]] people even claim to have bought magic scrolls from the old hermit. [[But]] I would not believe everything that you hear. 
I knew that if [[Cyrrus]] became a farmer, he would be poor for the rest of life. Gwillim does not know that I convinced [[Cyrrus]] to seek the [[Theurgists]], but I had to, for [[Cyrrus]]' sake. [[Now]] he can lead a life far richer than that of a farm man. 
[[My]], but you do ask many questions! [[But]] yes, [[Cyrrus]] loves animals. [[He]] has always been a caring man. 
I'm sorry if I ask too many questions. 
No, I am sorry if I made you uncomfortable. I enjoy your company! [[As]] I said, we do not see many visitors here, I am glad to have someone to talk to. 
Farewell
