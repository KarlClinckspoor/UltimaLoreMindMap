The way of [[Stratos]] is never easy, for the trait [[Stratos]] requires most above all in her followers is honesty. A great battle was raging and the king was gravely wounded. A follower of [[Stratos]] was called to administer healing. On the way to the king's tent the [[Acolyte]] saw the battle was going quite badly for the king's men. When the [[Acolyte]] arrived at the king's side, the king was already breathing his last. There was little the [[Acolyte]] could do. [[In]] a whisper the king asked how his troops fared. With little hesitation the [[Acolyte]] told him it was going badly. The king gripped the [[Acolyte]]'s arm and thanked him for speaking honestly, for though lies would have given him strength for the moment, the truth made him stronger for a lifetime. Thus we see that the way of truth may not be the easiest, but it is the best.
