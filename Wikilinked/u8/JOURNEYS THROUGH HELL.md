[[Day]] 1: [[Dear]] E- I have found my journey to be one of great suffering although I have only been at it such a short time.  
[[Day]] 2: [[My]] darling- I am constantly lost and without friends in this land of nightmares. I do not know if I will live to see you again, my love.  
[[Day]] 3: [[Madam]]- [[Perhaps]] [[Dr]]. Dee was correct. I should have listened to his sound advice, for I am now so terribly lonely and wish with all my heart to be with you again.  
[[Day]] 4: I can barely scare up enough courage to stop my vigil of self preservation long enough to share my experiences with you.  
[[Day]] 5: There is no hope in sight. I am tired and I do not know if I can outlast this trial. I have been fighting for days now...[[If]] only there were some reprieve from this torment. I simply cannot bear it any more. I do not think that I shall feel worthy of writing to you for a few days.  
[[Day]] 13: [[Luck]] has finally discovered me. [[At]] last, I have an answer to the one way I can rid myself of this [[Hell]]! I know of a bridge to a veritable paradise, yea, an oasis! in this desert of heat and flame.  
[[Day]] 14: [[Odd]], but I cannot quite get this strange apparatus to work properly. I came across it in my travels, and after much searching, I believe that it must have something to do with several odd spheres that I have in my possession. I don't know if I will ever figure it out. [[Ha]], silly me, to doubt my abilities when I am so very close to freedom! Today, victory over 'their' [[Pyros]]. Tomorrow, freedom, and back to you, sweet [[Temperance]]!
