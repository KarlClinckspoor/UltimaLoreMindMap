[[In]] my investigations of the royal bloodline I have uncovered many facts---facts have lead me to more questions. [[Keldan]] the farmer, son of [[Treal]]. Forced to marry [[Lord]] [[Kean]]'s daughter, [[Celidia]]. Why would royalty want such a simple man? [[Keldan]] and [[Ariel]]... [[Did]] [[Celidia]] ever know? [[If]] so, when did she find out? [[And]] how? [[Ariel]] had a child, a son. [[Did]] [[Keldan]] send her away to protect them from [[Celidia]], or did [[Celidia]] order it?  
  
[[Celidia]] demanded a child. [[Mordea]] is born with the powers of [[Tempestry]]. Yet [[Lord]] [[Kean]] was no [[Tempest]], nor was his wife... [[But]] where is [[Keldan]] and [[Ariel]]'s son? [[Both]] mother and child sent to live with the fishermen... [[Devon]] knows not his own father... Could [[Devon]] be a [[Tempest]]?!!? [[If]] so, by his being the first birth, his powers would be stronger than [[Mordea]]'s! I must investigate this further, though if [[Mordea]] should uncover my quest, my life will be forfeit...
