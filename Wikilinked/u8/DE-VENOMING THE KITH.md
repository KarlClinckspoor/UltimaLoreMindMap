[[By]] [[Ioria]]  
  
[[Removing]] the venom sacs from a kith should only be done to an animal between the ages of four to six days. Sedate the kith by allowing it to inhale the vapors of boiling kalas leaves and mushroom spores. [[Do]] not breathe these vapors or intense headaches and dizzyness will occur. [[Once]] the animal is sedated, roll it over onto its back and locate the bony plate at the base of the mandible. Insert a wedge or pick into the seam at the base of this plate, and press firmly until the plate begins to slide. [[It]] will still be attached to the abdomen by several fiberous bands.  
  
[[Lay]] the plate back over the abdomen and locate a pale membrane near the base of the mandible. Make an incision diagonally across the membrane and wedge it open. Inside there is a purple muscle. Slide this muscle towards the [[Kith]]'s head, and underneath is a green or yellow gland with two tubes leading into the throat. Wrap the gland in a heavy cloth, and clamp off the larger of the tubes as close to the gland as possible. Cut the tube just behind the clamp, and firmly squeeze the gland until any venom in it has been forced down the remaining tube. Cut the second tube and lift out the empty gland.  
  
[[Now]] stitch together the ends of the tubes, and fill the cavity with the boiled kalas leaves. Slide the muscle back in place, and stitch the membrane closed. Repeat the process at the base of the second mandible. When both glands have been removed, lay the plate back over the exposed area, and bind to the kiths's body with cord or bandages until it re-attaches. [[Note]]: [[Some]] kith have no venom sac on the right side of the head. [[If]] the gland is not visible after opening the cavity, it may be one of these animals, but search the area throughly before closing the cavity.
