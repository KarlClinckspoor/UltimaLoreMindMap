Guardsman! 
'Tis the wrath of the [[Titans]] that rains upon us. May they have mercy, for we are all to die! Run while you can. 
[[Hold]]! You are not undead. I suggest you find a haven and hide, stranger. The walking dead march upon the city! 
What is it this time? 
What can I do for you? 
What! [[More]] questions! 
What do you want, stranger? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
Bye 
Why do you want to know? 
[[Only]] fools and meddlers go around asking every stranger they meet their name. 
[[My]] job is to guard the new [[Tempest]], of course. 
[[My]] job is to guard her Ladyship [[Mordea]], of course! 
You are in the palace of the [[Tempest]]. 
Look, I do not have time for idle chat with strangers. 
Push off, before [[Mordea]] has both our heads. 
I must be about my duties anyway. 
[[Oh]], I heard you had a part in ridding us of [[Mordea]]. 
[[Do]] not tell anyone I said this, but, thanks.
