This object, named by [[Corodin]], the first [[Master]] [[Sorcerer]], has been handed down from [[Master]] to [[Master]] since the [[Binding]] of [[Pyros]]. [[It]] is the key to the power of the [[Sorcerers]]. [[If]] you are reading this book then most likely you are now the [[Master]] [[Sorcerer]], having either outlived or killed the [[Master]]. [[As]] such, I admonish you to keep both this book and the [[Tongue]] always in a safe place, away from prying eyes. The [[Tongue]] was used in the [[Binding]] to house a portion of [[Pyros]]' being. This allows all [[Sorcerers]] to call upon [[His]] powers in the ways that we have defined as spells. The rituals involved are used to provide protection for the [[Sorcerer]] creating the enchantment.  
  
[[Another]] power that the [[Tongue]] imparts to the one who wields it is the ability to amplify the power of spells and spell foci. [[Perhaps]] it's most important purpose is it's capability to summon forth and banish [[Pyros]] [[Himself]]. This is a truly dangerous excercise and requires four [[Acolytes]], but the rewards can be great. [[His]] knowledge is often useful, and [[His]] power is seemingly limitless, as is [[His]] temper. Should [[He]] become free in this [[Ritual]] of [[Fire]], as is quite possible, know that you have most likely doomed [[Morgaelin]] to a flaming death. A final warning, should the [[Tongue]] of [[Flame]] ever enter the [[Great]] [[Pentacle]], the fate of all [[Pagans]] will be sealed. The [[Lord]] of [[Flame]] shall be rejoined with the power in the [[Tongue]] and as a result, [[He]] will be forever unbound.
