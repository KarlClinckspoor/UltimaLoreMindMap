CAPTAIN'S REPORT  
  
I recomend the new young guard Grommet for a commendation for bravery. As a troll, larger than most, marched directly and purposefully toward our station, we prepared to destroy it from a safe distance with firegems. Before we attacked, Grommet saw that it carried in it's arms a little girl. We hesitated in our attack, and he charged out and met the beast with his sword drawn.In the ensuing battle the troll was driven to it's knees, and as it begged for it's life, Grommet slew the creature. Some of Grommets blows flew a little awry, and the little girl was mortally injured by one of them. She was only a peasant however, and of no import. Grommet will make a fine addition to the officers ranks.
