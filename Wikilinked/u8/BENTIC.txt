[[Bentic]] the dead librarian 
[[Bentic]] the Librarian 
[[Bentic]]
librarian 
man 
[[Please]] return that within two weeks! 
I am attacked! Help! 
Help! [[Sorcerer]]! 
Greetings! 
Greetings, [[Bentic]]! 
[[My]] name is 
.
Hello, hello, 
Hello! I am glad to see you again.
[[How]] are you? 
What do you do? 
bye 
Greetings, stranger. 
What is your name? 
[[By]] trade, I am the librarian of this city, however, I prefer to think of myself as a student of life. [[One]] who spends his time observing all facets of life. I am a great studier of people. You would be amazed at the things you may learn by simply observing your neighbors in their everyday life. 
Tell me of the library. 
Tell me of the people. 
Tell me of your neighbors. 
[[Orlok]] says you have a treasure map. 
[[My]] name is [[Bentic]]. [[It]] is a word of [[Pagan]] derivation. I think it originally meant 'he who toils hard', but that is not for certain. I have found a number of references to 'Ventac' in several older texts and feel that this may be the root of the name '[[Bentic]].' [[And]] what is your name, friend? 
What is '[[Pagan]]'? 
What are you reading? 
I am quite well. You know, since I saw you last I have done a little more reading into the meaning of various names. I am more certain now that my name does stem from the ancient 'Ventac' as I also found one very old reference where it was spelled 'Bentac'. 
[[Now]], the interesting point is that I did some research on your name and found that, in one case, it actually comes from the very old [[Pagan]] word for 'champion' or, a better translation, 'avatar'. 
I'm so glad you asked. I'm actually doing quite well. Since I last spoke to you, I've done a little more research into names. I did, indeed, find a very old reference to 'Ventac' and I intend to do a little more research in the origin of names. I would love to do some research on your name. What is your name, friend? 
Well met, 
. I am pleased to meet you.
[[Ah]], I am so glad you asked. This is a treatise on the world of [[Pagan]]. [[It]] covers the idiosyncrasies of the various lands and people of our world. [[From]] the first chapter it takes an in depth look at what motivates the people of this world, and challenges the reader to make up his own mind about the condition of this world in which we live. [[Perhaps]] you would like to read it. 
[[Yes]], thank you. 
No, thank you. 
Who is the author? 
[[Ah]], I knew you were a well read person who appreciates fine literature. [[Perhaps]] after you have read it, we could get together and discuss your opinion of it. 
I hope you enjoy it! 
[[Oh]] my, you are carrying a lot of things. I'll just keep this 'til you have more room. 
Well, perhaps when you have more time. 
Well ... ummm, you see ... well, I am. 
The library is my joy. [[It]] is where I spend all my time, studying the words left by our predecessors. You can not believe what is in these books. They contain the wisdom of many ages in them. Too many people overlook the knowledge of our past generations, because of this, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.
Tell me of the books. 
[[Ah]], are you a student of life as well? I do so enjoy finding someone who shares the same passions as I do. The people here in [[Tenebrae]] are a varied and fascinating lot. They go about their daily toils, laboring under the yoke of a somewhat ... restrictive government and yet still find the time to enjoy themselves occasionally.
A restrictive government? 
I think the one I like to spend the most time with is [[Devon]]. [[He]] is such a sharp fellow. I think he has far more potential than even he realizes. 
[[Devon]] has potential? 
I've met [[Devon]]. 
[[Have]] you? [[Oh]], he is such a nice fellow. We've spent hours in conversation here. [[He]] is really quite sharp. Loves books almost as much as I do. [[In]] some ways he knows more about [[Pagan]] than I. 
Does he know how I may leave [[Pagan]]? 
[[Yes]], I can't put my finger on it, but there is something there. [[Call]] it a hunch, if you will. I just seem to feel that there is something about him that suggests great things. [[He]] does love to read. Maybe he is destined to be a great scholar. 
[[My]] library is full of many books. Are you a scholar as well? [[Oh]], I am so happy to have met you. [[Please]] feel free to make use of my library and books. We shall have many interesting discussions, I am sure. 
Hmmm, it is not quite the safe thing to discuss here. [[Even]] my interest in knowledge and books can not protect me from [[Lady]] [[Mordea]]. You might say she has a rather...short temper. Why, just recently her guards confiscated my personal diary, though I don't have any idea why. 
I wish to leave [[Pagan]]. 
Leave [[Pagan]]? [[My]] goodness, I don't think I've ever had anyone ask for that, but then again, you don't act, talk or dress like anyone I've ever seen before. [[Let]]'s see, I can only suggest you speak to someone with more magic abilities than I. [[Mythran]] could help you or, though I dread to suggest it, perhaps the [[Necromancer]] could help you. 
Who is [[Mythran]]? 
[[Necromancer]]? 
[[Oh]], they're not as bad as many of the people in this city make out. Their magic is a little macabre, I suppose, but they do have quite a bit of magic at their call. They serve [[Lithos]], you know. 
Who is [[Lithos]]? 
[[How]] many are there? 
There used to be many, but, the sentiment here in [[Tenebrae]] is against them so they have very few new recruits. I believe there are only one or two of them left. [[It]]'s too bad, really. Their magic is so very different from the [[Tempest]]. 
[[How]] is the magic different? 
The magic of the [[Tempest]] is hereditary, while the magic of the [[Necromancers]] may be learned and gained through tests and trials. [[Not]] that everyone can be a [[Necromancer]], mind you. [[Not]] everyone has the stomach for it. 
[[Mythran]] lives in a small house on the [[Plateau]]. [[He]] has been known to dabble in the various magical arts and is a scholar. [[He]] often makes magical scrolls and things and sells them. 
[[Mythran]] practices magical arts? 
[[Mythran]] is a scholar? 
Where is the [[Plateau]]? 
[[From]] the palace in the center of [[Tenebrae]], head north out of the city. [[Follow]] the path through the Valley to a cave entrance. Go through the cave. [[It]] opens on the other side of the mountain on the [[Plateau]]. 
[[Yes]], though I'm not sure what school he follows. 
What schools? 
Why the four elemental schools, of course. There are those who follow [[Lithos]] and practice his magic. These spells are mostly earth-based spells. They require long hours of study and practice to cast correctly, or so I've read. The Tempestual magics of [[Hydros]] are only available through heredity and so are unavailable to the majority. [[Now]] the magics of [[Pyros]], the fire elemental are quite spectacular to watch, but very dangerous to the caster. [[Stratos]], on the other hand provides healing magics, although she requires strict obedience to her tenets.
Well, of sorts. [[He]] enjoys studying and reading books as I do, but he will form an opinion and tout it as perfect. [[He]] will even cite his own writings as examples of perfect creative thinking. This makes talking to him a bit ... tedious. [[But]] he is a good source of information.
The [[Earth]] [[Titan]], or [[Mountain]] [[King]] as he is sometimes called. [[He]] is a very powerful [[Titan]], has the ability to make the very ground shake. The [[Necromancers]] still serve him, though I understand they have very few applicants to be an apprentice these days. 
[[Pagan]]? Why, that is the name of this place. 
I thought this place was '[[Tenebrae]]'. 
No, no. [[That]] is the name of this city. '[[Pagan]]' is the name of this land, this all encompassing world upon which we all live out our meager lives. 
Your meager lives? 
When you take into consideration the scope of this world and its history, anything we do or accomplish becomes virtually meaningless. We are but a fraction of the blink of an eye in the history of [[Pagan]]. 
A treasure map? 
[[Yes]], tattooed on your chest. 
What?! [[Oh]], that is so silly. Of course I don't have a map tattooed on my chest! I don't know why he'd even say such a thing. [[Oh]] well, I will have to go straightened that out. No, no I don't have a map tattooed on my chest. [[Now]], tattoos are another interesting subject. 
Tell me of tattoos. 
[[Do]] you know of any treasure maps? 
Well, you know where they come from, don't you? They were sailors' method of identifying themselves. [[If]] a sailor was washed overboard, it might be days or weeks before anyone found his body. When they did find it, it would be very likely any nonpermanent form of identification would be gone. [[So]] tattoos became popular as a permanent method of identificaion. While tattoos have never been my style, a great number of people find them very attractive and adorn themselves with all sorts of pictures. 
What sort of pictures? 
While many choose the traditional anchor or skull and dagger, there are others who prefer more unusual things such as bats or intricate knotwork. 
Bats? 
Intricate knotwork? 
Bats 
[[In]] some cultures, the bat tattoo is a symbol of royalty. [[However]], it is normally worn in a place that is covered by clothing, so that the monarch may go in disguise if necessary. 
This sort of tattoo can usually be found around the top of the bicep or around the ankle. The ankle is the area preferred by women, the bicep by men. 
No, no maps. Wait a minute, now I do recall a story about a magical hammer named '[[Bone]] [[Crusher]].' Had something to do with the undead skeletons. Hmmmm, perhaps you might find it if you looked through some of the books here in my library. 
[[Come]] back anytime, 
. I so love a good conversation!
Thank you for dropping by, and come visit me any time.
[[Yes]], well, I guess I'll get back to my research now. 
I never knew that! 
[[Ah]], yes... 
Fascinating! 
Very interesting. 
Such a good book. 
hummm... 
I must make a note of this. 
I wonder if [[Devon]] knows this? 
I will have to read more on this.
