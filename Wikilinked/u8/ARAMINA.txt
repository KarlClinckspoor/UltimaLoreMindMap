[[Aramina]]
servant 
girl 
I would not do that if I were you! 
Beren, help me! 
Help me, [[Sorcerer]]! 
May I help you? 
Leave my home, stranger! 
[[Yes]], my friend? 
Why are you in my home? 
Can I get you anything? 
I'm afraid I must ask you to leave. 
I'm warning you! 
Are you lost, my friend? 
[[Out]] of my house! 
You try my patience! 
I must remember to get some butter. 
hmmmm 
No rest for the weary. 
I must change the bed linens. 
[[Oh]], my poor back. 
I just want to sit down for a moment. 
I sure could use a day off. 
[[Oh]], my aching bones. 
[[Yes]], I am 
.
AAhhhhhh! 'Tis another dead one! AAAAHHHHHHHHH! 
I'd love to stay and talk, but [[Devon]] needs me right now, and...well, you know. [[Talk]] to you later, Ta-ta! 
I am sorry, but I can not talk to you now. I must attend to her ladyship. 
Find me later at my house in east [[Tenebrae]], I will be there at bloodwatch. 
[[How]] may I serve you, stranger? 
[[By]] what are you called? 
bye 
[[Good]] morrow to you. 
[[Have]] you met [[Devon]]? 
What do you do here? 
What do you know of treasure? 
[[Good]] day to you, stranger. 
What is your name? 
'Tis a grand day, friend 
I'm looking for a dagger. 
What miserable weather this is. 
Forgive me for not introducing myself earlier. [[My]] name is [[Aramina]]. 
[[My]] name is [[Aramina]]. 
I am merely a servant here. 
Tell me about the palace. 
This is the home of our [[Tempest]], the [[Lady]] [[Mordea]]. 
Tell me of [[Lady]] [[Mordea]]. 
Well, it is not good for me to speak of my employer behind her back, but I will tell you she is a hard woman. 
Why do you say she is hard? 
[[She]] will stop at nothing to preserve her power here. [[Nothing]], not even murder. [[She]] hardly notices my existence. [[At]] least she does not take pleasure in tormenting me like her seneschal does. 
[[She]] wishes to preserve power? 
Murder? 
Tell me of the seneschal. 
Murder? [[Did]] I say murder? [[Oh]] no, I meant nothing like that. I meant mother, that's it, mother. [[She]] is like a mother to her people. 
(I think she trumps up charges against people who question her authority and then uses the laws of execution to eliminate them...legal murder.) 
[[Salkind]] is her  seneschal. ([[Salkind]], that evil, perverted man, is her seneschal.) 
[[Salkind]] is her seneschal. 
Tell me of [[Salkind]]. 
The power of the [[Tempestry]], milord. The power to control the weather. This is, indeed, great power. 
Tell me of the [[Tempestry]]. 
[[Tempestry]], milord? Surely you have heard of it. [[It]] is the power that is transferred through the bloodline of the [[Tempests]]. 
What do you mean by 'bloodline'? 
What power is transferred? 
[[It]] is inherited, father to son, mother to daughter. 
[[As]] I said, milord, the power to control the weather. While at times, a good thing, it can be a powerful weapon to hold over the people's heads. 
[[She]] holds it over her people's heads? 
I mean...I mean it is a powerful tool to help the people's herds... of torax, that is. ([[Yes]], she threatens to make the weather bad, or worse yet, send them to the [[Lurker]], if they don't do her bidding.) [[Please]], ask me no more. I am afraid [[Salkind]] will punish me. 
I mean...I mean it is a powerful tool to help the people's herds.... of torax, that is. [[Please]], ask me no more. I am afraid [[Salkind]] will punish me. 
[[Salkind]] punishes you? 
Punished? No, no, not punished...er, pampered, yes, that's it, pampered by... [[Salkind]]. ([[He]] is a horrid man who delights in tormenting me. [[He]] says lewd things and puts his hands on me. There is nothing I can do.) 
Punished? No, no, not punished... er,pampered, yes that's it, pampered by...[[Salkind]]. [[Please]], friend, I do not wish to speak of it. 
[[He]] sets me to difficult tasks, then delights in tormenting me until I am barely able to complete them. 
What difficult tasks does he give you? 
[[How]] does he torment you? 
No, no, certainly not difficult, rather, challenging, [[That]]'s it, he gives me challenging tasks. For instance, he will give me a very small brush and tell me to clean the floor of his room. Then he will arrive, his boots muddy from his walks along the shore, and track mud all over the floor I just cleaned. [[He]] then points the dirt out to me and chastises me for poor work, calling me a no good slackard. 
[[Perhaps]] 'torment' is too strong a word. Actually, he is quite the joker. For instance, just today he was walking down the hall toward me when he suddenly cornered me and began to pinch and grab my body. Don't you think that is funny? 
yes 
no 
[[Oh]],...well...I guess perhaps some find it humorous. I must be back to my chores now. 
No? Really? [[Truly]], I didn't find it very humorous either. [[But]] he finds it hilarious. [[So]], I smile and try my best to stay out of his way. There is precious little I can do. 
[[Speak]] up about it! 
Slap him! 
[[Oh]], you are very nice, and I appreciate your concern, however, who would I speak to? [[Lady]] [[Mordea]]? No, she dotes on him. [[Darion]]? [[He]] simply would not believe me. No, my friend, I need this job. [[Speaking]] of keeping my job, I need to get back to work. 
No, my friend, I have no desire to lose my job nor my head, for to strike the seneschal would be considered treason. I would be beheaded before the next morning. Well, I must get back to work now. 
[[It]] is good to see you smile, [[Aramina]]. 
I have you to thank for it. You did save [[Devon]], didn't you? 
[[Yes]], I did. 
Well, it was nothing, really. 
I am [[Aramina]], my friend. I work here in the palace for [[Devon]]. You're 
, aren't you? [[Devon]] speaks of you often.
[[Yes]], I knew it was you. [[Did]] you really save him?
[[Oh]], I can't thank you enough. [[He]] is so... so... well, just dreamy. 
[[Did]] you say ... 'dreamy'? 
Uh huh. [[He]] is the nicest man. [[He]] never torments me like that nasty old [[Salkind]] did. Why he even asked me to eat supper with him the other night ... in the dining room no less. Then we went for a walk outside and he picked a flower for me...ME! a simple servant girl...did you ever hear of anything so romantic? I just can't get over it ... 
Uhm, ... I've got to leave now. 
...and those eyes. [[Did]] you ever see eyes like that? They're just so blue, I could get lost in them. I tell you ... 
[[Devon]]? Well, I know him but I've never actually met him. [[But]] I think I'd like to. 
You'd like to meet him? 
You know of him? 
[[Once]], when I was sent to the store to purchase something for [[Lady]] [[Mordea]], he was there. I thought he had the nicest smile. 
I've seen him and I know his name. I rarely get to meet anyone outside. 
I know [[Devon]]. 
You do? [[Oh]], is he as nice as he looks? [[He]] has such a nice smile. [[And]] his eyes, they're blue aren't they? I really think he's handsome. [[Do]] you think that you might mention me to him next time you see him? 
Of course I will. 
I'm sorry, I can not. 
[[That]] is very thoughtful of you. [[Now]], I must get back to work. 
[[Oh]] ... well, I guess I understand, me being a lowly servant and all. [[He]] probably wouldn't be interested in me anyway. I'm just a silly girl for even dreaming it. [[Now]], if you'll excuse me, sir, I must get back to work. There are floors yet to be scrubbed. 
A dagger? Hmmm, I saw a dagger once. [[Mordea]] kept it in a chest in her room. I have the key. Would you like it? 
[[Yes]]! 
No, thank you anyway. 
A dagger? I know nothing of daggers. I am just a servant to the [[Lady]]. 
I need help. 
Are you certain? 
[[My]], it must be an important dagger for you to get that excited over it. [[Oh]] well, it always made me feel most uneasy. Well, here is the key. 
Suit yourself. 
I am not surprised by that, m'lord. [[Many]] people are in need of help these days. 
Others are in need of help? 
[[Not]] due to [[Lady]] [[Mordea]], mind you. I-I'm certain that anyone out there who suffers or is hungry is in such a state due to their own laziness. 
[[Yes]], mmm... Look, I do not want to get into any trouble, m'lord. [[Please]], do not ask me to do anything that might cause me to anger the [[Lady]]. 
You won't get into trouble. 
[[Never]] mind. 
Very well, thank you. 
Ohh, I do not know why, but I am going to trust you. [[Mordea]] keeps a very special dagger in a locked chest. You will find the chest in a small closet near her bed. 
[[It]]'s in a chest? 
[[Yes]] and I have the key. I will give you the key, but you must promise not to tell -anyone- where you got it. 
I promise. 
I can't promise that. 
Very well, here it is. 
[[Do]] what you will with it, but remember: You did not get that key from me. 
Well, then I can not give you the key. Farewell. 
[[Yes]], it is terrible. We've had leaks in the roof and walls, and people tracking mud all through the palace. [[It]] makes it twice as hard for me. 
[[Only]] what I've heard from [[Orlok]]. [[And]] no one can believe what he says. Though, now that I think about it, I heard [[Salkind]] mention something about a magic hammer that he wanted to find. 
What did [[Salkind]] say? 
What magic hammer? 
[[Oh]], he said he was going to get a couple of strong men to dig for treasure they heard about from [[Orlok]]. I can't imagine why they would want to do that. [[Everyone]] knows you can't trust [[Orlok]]'s stories. [[But]], I guess [[Salkind]] did. 
[[Did]] he say where? 
I don't remember exactly, something about a stand of mushrooms to the south of town. Wait, don't tell me you are going chasing after one of [[Orlok]]'s stories! 
[[Yes]], I believe there is treasure there. 
[[If]] there was treasure there to be found, [[Salkind]] would have found it, he is just that kind of a lucky weasel. [[But]] I know he didn't find anything for he came back with his robes ripped and in a foul temper which I felt the brunt of for several days. I think it had to do with the dangerous beasts that live in the wilds. 
Dangerous beasts? 
[[Oh]] yes, I heard several of the men who went with [[Salkind]] talking about trolls and such they encountered. [[If]] you must go, please, be careful. 
You know, the one [[Orlok]] says his great-great-great-granpappy fought off the water [[Titan]] with. I think [[Orlok]] would give his great-great-great-granpappy credit with creating this world, if he could. 
Thank you, sir. 
Why is this open?
