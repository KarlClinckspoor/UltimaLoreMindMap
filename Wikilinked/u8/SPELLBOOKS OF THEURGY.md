The [[Spell]] of [[Divination]]  
The divination spell is a most practical spell. [[It]] allows the caster to know his exact location, the time of day, the day of the week, and the current month. The [[Focus]] necessary for casting this spell resembles a sextant. The spell also has a vocal aspect. The words that must be uttered at the moment of casting are '[[In]] [[Wis]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Healing]] [[Touch]]  
This is the least powerful of the healing spells of [[Stratos]] and one of the first usually learned by [[Adepts]]. The [[Focus]] necessary to cast this spell represents a pointing hand. The words that must be uttered at the moment of casting are '[[In]] [[Mani]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Aerial]] [[Servant]]  
[[One]] of the more impressive of the [[Theurgic]] spells, [[Aerial]] [[Servant]] is also one of the most versatile. Upon casting of the [[Aerial]] [[Servant]] spell, a whirling being of [[Air]] is called into existance. This being will accept the [[Theurgist]]'s directives to manipulate or move any object. [[One]] of the more interesting aspects of this spell is that the [[Aerial]] [[Servant]] is able to move objects through another solid object, such as a door or wall. The [[Focus]] used to represent this spell represents an [[Arm]] [[Band]] and the casting words are '[[Kal]] [[Ort]] [[Xen]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Reveal]]  
This spell is a dissipation spell, meaning that it will actually dispell another type of magic, specifically the spell of invisibility. When the [[Theurgist]] casts this spell, a wave of energy moves away from the caster in ever increasing concentric circles. These energy waves will dispell all forms of invisibility. The [[Focus]] used for this spell is an open eye and the casting words are '[[Ort]] [[Lor]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Restoration]]  
[[One]] of the most powerful spells available to the [[Theurgist]], this spell restores the recipient to full health, providing the recipient is still alive upon the beginning of the casting. [[It]] will eliminate wounds and maimings and will cure disease. This spell is one that the [[Theurgist]] will find in great demand. The [[Focus]] for this spell resembles an open hand. The words which must be uttered upon casting the spell are '[[Vas]] [[In]] [[Mani]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Fade]] [[From]] [[Sight]]  
This spell is another very versatile spell as it allows the caster to become invisible to the sight of nearly all mortal beings. The [[Focus]] representing this spell is a closed eye. The words to be spoken during the casting are '[[Quas]] [[An]] [[Lor]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Air]] Walk  
The [[Air]] Walk spell is the most highly valued spell a [[Theurgist]] can learn, for it is only through the use of this spell that a [[Theurgist]] can reach [[Stratos]] and hear the [[Mystic]] [[Voice]]. When this spell is cast, the [[Theurgist]] is capable of jumping quite a great distance with the aid of the surrounding air. [[It]] is interesting to note, that the first time a [[Theurgist]] experiences this spell is when he has completed the [[Tests]] and seeks [[Stratos]] for the first time. [[If]] [[Stratos]] is pleased with the [[Theurgist]], then she will grant the spell without the use of a [[Focus]]. [[From]] that point on, however, the [[Theurgist]] must have the [[Focus]] representing wings to cast this spell. Words of power must also be spoken. For this spell those words are '[[Vas]] [[Hur]] [[Por]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Hear]] [[Truth]]  
A useful spell for any number of reasons. This spell allows the [[Theurgist]] to hear both what the speaker is saying and what the truth is. [[If]] the speaker is, indeed, speaking untruthfully, the truth will come to the caster as if carried on a breeze. The [[Focus]] for this spell resembles a chain. The words spoken upon casting are '[[An]] [[Quas]] [[Lor]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Intervention]]  
A powerful spell, upon casting the spell of [[Intervention]], the [[Theurgist]] calls into being a wall of [[Air]] that blocks all damaging forces. While this spell will protect the caster from all blows and striking attacks, it will not protect the caster from immersion in lava or drowning in [[Water]]. The [[Focus]] for this spell resembles a fist and the words used are '[[In]] [[Sanct]] [[An]] [[Jux]].'  
  
The [[Spell]] of [[Resurrection]]  
[[As]] told to [[Cyrrus]] by [[Stellos]]  
  
[[In]] all my time as the leader of the [[Theurgists]] on [[Argentrock]] [[Isle]], I hold dearest to my heart the time I received the [[Spell]] of [[Resurrection]] from the [[Mystic]] [[Voice]] that is our dear [[Stratos]].I was no more than 60 when [[Kalen]] brought the body of his beloved to me. [[She]] had been dead for a number of days, and I knew there was not much I could do. [[However]], I saw the love that burned in [[Kalen]]'s eyes and knew I had to try. I took the body of the woman to [[Windy]] [[Point]] and begged [[Stratos]] to return the spirit to the body. [[Stratos]] told me that the price would be high. I agreed to it, without hesitation.  
  
[[At]] that point began the journey I will never forget. [[My]] spirit left my body and I began to fly. [[Oh]], the glorious freedom, to fly above the clouds and soar the open skies. [[As]] I flew higher, the winds became stronger, soon it was a battle just to continue, but I struggled onward. [[Suddenly]], before my eyes there was a shimmering cloud. [[It]] was on the edge of the sky and the [[Ethereal]] [[Void]]. Undaunted, I flew into the cloud, and what did I behold but a brilliant ball of fire and light. [[Stratos]] whispered to me that I beheld what hadn't been seen by a [[Pagan]] in years...something called the sun.  
  
[[At]] that moment, my body back on the ground opened its mouth and breathed the [[Breath]] of [[Life]] into the body of [[Keldan]]'s betrothed. The next thing I new, I was surrounded by darkness and back in my body. I asked what had happened and why it was so dark. [[At]] that, [[Keldan]] began to weep. [[It]] was then I knew that in viewing this wonderful sun, I had lost my sight. [[But]] I know it was a small price to pay, for [[Keldan]]'s betrothed put her soft hand in mine and thanked me for returning her to [[Keldan]]. This is a price I would ask no other to pay and therefore, there is no focus or words of power for it.
