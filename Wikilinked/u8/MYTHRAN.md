Very well. 
There is only one spell which I have bothered to transcribe onto scrolls. This spell enables the caster to dispel magics that seal entryways and portals. Unlike other spells, you do not need to learn this spell before casting it. However, the magics upon the scroll will disappear after you read it, so you may use each spell of opening once. 
You wish to buy the Scroll of Dispelling Magical Portals? 
Aye. 
Nay. 
Since the ink and parchment do have a cost to them, as well as the time I take to transcribe the magical words, I must ask you for 50 obsidians. 
As you know, I must charge you 50 obsidians for the scroll. 

Perhaps you wish to discuss something other than scrolls. 
I will pay that. 
I cannot pay that. 
Excellent. Use this well. 
My friend, it seems you have not the obsidian for this. Of course, I realize you were not attempting to fool me, but perhaps you should return later when you can pay the fee. 
I am sorry that I cannot help you then. Perhaps you should return later when you can pay the fee. 
Do you wish to purchase the reagents of [[Necromancy]], Sorcery, or those specific to Thaumaturgy? 
You do realize that I only have reagents for the spells I teach. Do you wish to purchase the reagents of [[Necromancy]], Sorcery, or those specific to Thaumaturgy? 
[[Necromancy]]. 
Sorcery. 
Thaumaturgy. 
Nevermind. 
Do you wish to buy Bone, Executioner's Hood, or [[Blackmoor]]? 
Do you wish to buy Obsidian, Brimstone, Pumice, Ash, or Pig Iron? 
Do you wish to buy Eye of Newt, Bat Wing, Serpent Scale, or Dragon Blood?

Perhaps you are not so interested in reagents after all. 
You are ready for the final spell that I can teach you -- the spell that permits travel through the very Ether itself. 
It is too early for you to learn another spell. 
You are ready for your fifth lesson in Thaumaturgy -- the spell of complete devastation. 
You are ready for your fourth spell -- Call Destruction. 
You are ready for your third lesson in Thaumaturgy -- the spell of creature summoning. 
You are ready for your second spell -- Meteor Shower. 
You are ready for your first lesson in Thaumaturgy -- the blast of confusion. 
As you know, my friend, I am still forced to charge a modicum of obsidian for the knowledge I impart. 
Before we begin, I must confess that the eternal pursuit of knowledge, despite the solitude I afford myself on this dreary island, is costly. As I result, I am afraid I must charge you a modest fee to help defray the cost of my studies. Please accept my humble apologies for this inconvenience. 
 in obsidian chits.
Excellent. We can now begin. 
Here is the book that describes the process by which you cast the spell. Study it well and you shall quickly master the necessary aspects. 
Do not forget that you will need reagents for your spells. 
As you will learn from the book I have given you, each spell has particular components, in this case reagents, that are a required part of casting the spell. I can sell some of these to you if you wish, but only after you have read the spell and determined what reagents you will need. 
My friend, it seems you have not the obsidian for this. Of course, I realize you were not attempting to fool me, but perhaps you should return later when you -can- pay the fee. 
Perhaps you are not so interested in magic after all. 
Good day, 
Hello. 
May I ask your name? 
What an unusual house. 
Goodbye. 
Unusual? I do not see anything unusual about my living quarters. It does not differ from any other extra-dimensional abode. 
I am sorry, was my response unclear? You did hear me, I trust. 
Very well. Your mind is filled with many thoughts other than what we are discussing. We can resume this later. 
You may ask indeed, stranger. I am [[Mythran]]. By what name do you go, young one? 
I am called 
I do not wish to say.
Je pr‚fŠre ne point le dire.
Das will ich Euch lieber nicht verraten.
Very well then. Please tell me your business with me so that I may return to my activities. 
Greetings, 
. And how might I assist you?
 I do not wish to say.
Ah, I see, you do not wish to converse with me. I am sorry for your interruption. 
I have many questions. 
I wish to buy scrolls. 
I wish to learn spells. 
I wish to buy reagents. 
I wish to buy more reagents. 
Ah, good. It is always important to ask questions. That way one will never run out of things to learn. I cannot refuse one who has traversed ghoul-filled passages to meet with my hospitality. What are some of these questions? 
Tell me about [[Pagan]]. 
What do you do? 
How can I leave [[Pagan]]? 
Is there a haunted grove? 
What about [[Pagan]] history? 
Ah, yes. 
A haunted grove of trees? Well, I have heard such rumors applied to a circle of dead trees here on the plateau, though I will not confirm the existence of undead there. 
That is an interesting question. I do many things. I suppose I spend most of my time studying and exploring the mind. I do not believe that thoughts should be confined within the skull, so I study a little bit of everything. 
What do you study? 
To tell you would take nearly as much time as I have spent collecting the information. Suffice it to say that I try to learn as much about everything as I can. Of course, my preference is to study magic. 
Magic? 
You wish to learn spells from me? 
Perhaps in the future I will have the time to show you. 
Your question is quite broad in scope. Do you wish me to talk about the city, the island, or all of [[Pagan]]? 
The history of this land is quite long, and there is much I can tell you. Where would you prefer I start? 
Do you know of The [[Guardian]]? 
Ah, interesting question. Indeed I do. Furthermore, I know that -you- know of him as well. However, you will find that no one else on [[Pagan]] has heard anything other than that this mysterious [[Guardian]] spoke to the early Pagans to warn them of disaster. Perhaps, some other time and place, we may speak further on this subject. Ask of it no more for now, please. 
I have never had anyone ask such a question, 
. Do you truly wish a means off this world? Or are you simply testing the limits of my knowledge? I ask this because finding the answer would be extremely tedious, and I do not plan to toil for no reason.
I have never had anyone ask such a question. Do you truly wish a means off this world? Or are you simply testing the limits of my knowledge? I ask this because finding the answer would be extremely tedious, and I do not plan to toil for no reason. 
I plan to leave [[Pagan]]. 
This was a test. 
That 'tis, indeed, a tremendous task you are planning to undertake. I, myself, have given considerable thought to finding ways to cross into what you would call `other worlds.' I have not yet uncovered a solution. However, I -have- come to the conclusion that it is the power of the [[Titans]] that makes such travel impossible even for one with my command of the arcane. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that to depart from [[Pagan]], one must master the powers of all four of the [[Titans]]. I suppose the best place to begin is with one of the schools of magic. Have you spoken with the Necromancers?
Yes, I have. 
No, I have not. 
Then I expect you still have much more to learn about the powers of [[Necromancy]]. With enough study, perhaps, you will be able to master the abilities [[Lithos]] grants to his followers and use them to locate the other mages. Only by seeking the talents of all four [[Titans]] will you have any hope of succeeding in your mission. 
Then I expect you will have more to learn more about the powers of [[Necromancy]]. In fact, you must attempt to acquire those powers for yourself. With enough study, perhaps, you will be able to master the abilities [[Lithos]] grants to his followers and use them to locate the other mages. Only by seeking the talents of all four [[Titans]] will you have any hope of succeeding in your mission. 
That is the answer you wish to give me? How sad. Oh well, nevermind. 
I suggest you begin with the Necromancers, then. Speak with [[Vividos]] about becoming his apprentice. I realize the thought of dealing with the rituals of death may seem distasteful, but I expect it is something to which you must become accustomed if you wish to succeed. 
Then I suggest you begin with them. Speak with [[Vividos]] about becoming his apprentice once [[Lothian]] has passed on her powers to him. I realize the thought of dealing with the rituals of death may seem distasteful, but I expect it is something to which you must become accustomed if you wish to succeed. 
Where are the Necromancers? 
They reside in the cemetery. I believe you will wish to take the East Road from the city. I suggest you go with care, for many of the walking dead also reside in the graveyard. 
I do not like to be tested. Perhaps you should give me time to renew my desire to speak with you. 
May you fare well, stranger to this land. If there is anything in my house that will aid you on your journeys, feel free to help yourself. 
Wait. Before you go, my friend, I wish to give you two items that I believe will assist you in your travels. The first is an item of recall I acquired many years ago. When you find yourself in trouble, you may use this item to teleport to my front door. Througout the world there are other disks to which you can also be transported if you so wish, providing you can visualize these places. How powerful this item is, I cannot say, for I do not know whether other, stronger powers may prevent it from functioning at certain times.~Furthermore, I wish to give you this potion of healing, which will magically aid the recovery of your wounds. I will try to have others for you as you make return visits, but since the cost to me in time and energy is great, I will not have one for you every time you visit me.
Here. 
I will set it down for you. 
Again, fare well. 
Better than wasting your time and mine with a lengthy story when we could be discussing more interesting matters, let me simply suggest that you read my essay on the subject. The book should be around here somewhere. Most likely I have left it upstairs. Feel free to borrow it if you wish. 
Have we not already discussed this subject enough? Ah, very well, what is it you wish to know? 
Are they not all the same? 
The city. 
The island. 
All of [[Pagan]]. 
Actually, I meant the people. 
Enough about [[Pagan]]. 
Indeed, no, although many people use -- or should I say misuse -- the word `[[Pagan]]' to mean the world, the island, and, for a few ethnocentrics, the city. In actuality, [[Pagan]] is only the name for the world. 
To be honest, I know little about the people. A few come to visit me for my knowledge. And even fewer to buy my scrolls. I do know a little about the mages of [[Pagan]]. Is it them you are interested in knowing? 
Tell me of the mages. 
You sell scrolls? 
There are four of what I call 'schools' of magic on [[Pagan]] -- one for each of the [[Titans]]. The study of death and the ground is called [[Necromancy]]. It is the [[Necromancer]] who is responsible for carrying out the pact with [[Lithos]] by burying the dead and sending their spirits to him. 
The current [[Necromancer]], [[Vividos]], is fairly new to his position. This means that he has been away from the city for only a few years, and is, therefore, less reclusive. In time, however, he will have forgotten most of his social graces, and the people will find dealing with him as distasteful as they did his predecessors. 
The current [[Necromancer]], [[Lothian]], is very old. I expect she soon will be passing her role to her [[Apprentice]]. [[Vividos]] should handle the responsibility quite well. 
[[Tempestry]]'s main focus is water, though its aspect does involve combining with [[Hydros]]' sister [[Titan]], [[Stratos]], making storms as much a part of [[Tempestry]] as is the sea. Unlike the other schools, [[Tempestry]] is not learned. It is passed on through the bloodline. The eldest living [[Tempest]] possesses the greatest amount of power. However, as long as a younger [[Tempest]]'s spell does not contradict an elder's, the younger's magic will work fully. 
Since there seems to be little cap on the powers of [[Tempestry]], I am glad for the Pagans that [[Devon]] now rules [[Tenebrae]]. You should be commended for your role in that. 
Since there seems to be little cap on the powers of [[Tempestry]], it is a true tragedy that [[Mordea]] rules the city. I hope for the sake of the people that her reign is not a long one. 
[[Stellos]] was the first follower of [[Stratos]]. His Order of Enlightenment teaches [[Theurgy]], the study of the winds. He is a good and learned man, if you will permit me a judgement of ethics, who freely uses his powers of healing. 
The fourth school, Sorcery, involves the [[Titan]] of Fire. I have never spoken to [[Malchir]] in person, but I feel the [[Sorcerers]]' reputation for deceit is unchanged by his rise to power. Take care when dealing with those who consort with [[Pyros]], for it seems they become as wicked as he. 
Those are the mages of the four schools. Of course, they do not represent -all- aspects of magic on [[Pagan]]. 
What other magic exists? 
There is what I call Thaumaturgy. It is not tied to any of the [[Titans]], but borrows bits and pieces from any form of magic you can imagine. I am a practitioner of Thaumaturgy. 
Can you teach me Thaumaturgy? 
You are not ready yet, my friend. Perhaps, with a little more time to adjust to this world, you will be prepared. 
Indeed, I do. Do you wish to purchase some? 
Ah, [[Tenebrae]]. The city was not settled until near the end of the war between the Pagans and [[Zealans]]. After the [[Titans]] defeated the Destroyer, most of the world lay in such ruin and disarray that the few people who were left on the island congregated into a single community. They called their city [[Tenebrae]], meaning 'city of eternal twilight.' At first the Necromancers held rulership, but once [[Kalen]] became a [[Tempest]] as well, the people elected to have their leaders come from that line. 
Who is [[Kalen]]? 
The island is called [[Morgaelin]], same as the mountain -- or volcano -- from which it sprang. As far as the people know, this is the only piece of land remaining after the [[Titans]] vanquished the Destroyer. 
Much of this I have already told you from our discussion of [[Pagan]]'s history. 
The lands of this world once spanned great distances. At that time, the people were prosperous and -- for the most part -- unified. However, when the words of warning came from a mysterious being called the [[Guardian]], the population split into two factions: the [[Zealans]], who believed in the ancient traditions, and Pagans, who felt that the [[Guardian]]'s words meant the end of things that were.~The two factions fell to fighting against each other, while the very forces of the elements began to take form and grow. When a malevolent entity called the Destroyer attempted to conquer the world, the elements, who had amassed Titanic levels of power, rose to battle it. During the struggle, the lands were demolished, leaving only a few peoples scattered across a single island -- this island. Shortly thereafter the [[Zealans]] fell to their enemies, and the world became known as [[Pagan]].
He was the first [[Tempest]]. An early hero to the people, his life as a [[Necromancer]] was filled with some amount of tragedy. When we have time I will relate the history of this world to you, then you will have a better understanding. 
Yes. 
No. 
Perhaps another time, then. 
Hello, [[Mythran]]. 
Hello again. 
Good to see you, my friend. Is there some assistance I can give you? 
I want to learn magic. 
May I have another potion? 
Aye, my friend, I have had time to concoct another. 
Nay, my friend, I have not had the time to concoct another. Perhaps it will be ready for your next visit. 
Ah, interesting question. Perhaps some other time I can better answer that. Ask of it no more, please. 
Then I suggest you begin with them. Speak with [[Vividos]] about becoming his apprentice. I realize the thought of dealing with the rituals of death may seem distasteful, but I expect it is something to which you must become accustomed if you wish to succeed. 
Good evening, my friend, and farewell. 
Good morning, my friend, and farewell. 
Good day, my friend, and farewell. 
Wait. Before you go, my friend, I wish to give you two items that I believe will assist you in your travels. The first is an item of recall I acquire many years ago. When you find yourself in trouble, you may use this item to teleport to my front door. How powerful this item is, I cannot say, for I do not know whether other, stronger powers may prevent it from functioning at certain times.~Furthermore, I wish to give you this potion of healing, which will magically aid the recovery of your wounds. I will try to have others for you as you make return visits, but since the cost to me in time and energy is great, I will not have one for you every time you visit me.
Ah, greetings, traveler. How fare things? 
Things are well. 
I want to recreate the obelisk. 
I found this with the [[Sorcerers]]. 
Recreate the obelisk? Do you mean that you wish reconstruct the [[Blackrock]] obelisk of the Great Temple? Of course! You are hoping to use the conduit as a way to leave [[Pagan]]! I know just the spell you will need. You must cast the Ethereal Travel spell. I do not know where the spell will send you on your first attempt, though I expect the [[Titans]] will intervene and direct your journey. Should you encounter and defeat them, know that you would have the worship and admiration of all Pagans. Good luck... 
I am very glad to hear that. 
By the way, considering the tumultuous effect you have had on [[Pagan]], may I commend you on your ability to rouse, or should I say anger, the [[Titans]]. 
By the way, I hope you realize the effect of taking the Breath of Wind. The citizens have little in the way of healing now. Please understand that I do not disagree with your choice of action, but I wanted to be sure you are cognizant of the ramifications. 
By the way, I notice your presence carries with it a tremendous impact, so to speak. I assume the quakes are your responsibility. 
Is there perhaps something you wish to discuss? 
Very well, then, I shall return to my work. 
Very well, then, and what would that be? 
That piece of black stone? 
It is not obsidian, that much is obvious. I wonder if it could be... You say it came from the [[Sorcerers]], eh? It is possible you have found one of the Fragments of the obelisk in the Ancient Temple. 
Somewhere I have a book that might delve into greater detail. You're welcome to it if you can find it. I would strongly suggest that you study it closely before we continue our discussion. 
Farewell and good luck, 
I do not wish to do this. 
Kal Vas Grav Corp!
A pity...
