The lone stranger slowly rode into the desolate village on the back of his mammoth, white hordax. [[As]] he dismounted his beast, he threw the leathery reins over the closest tie rod, then slowly strode to the double doors of the tavern.Though the tavern roared with the laughter of drunken herdsmen, the jovial spirit quickly flattened like fresh manure thrown against a wall. [[Everyone]] turned as the caped stranger entered the smoke filled hovel. The darkly robed individual motioned with two fingers for the stiffest grog. The tavern master quickly obeyed, pouring the thick brew with shaky hands.The women folk left, claiming they needed to visit the house of fecal waste.  
  
'ShadowLander!' called a nasal tinged voice from the rear of the room, 'Your type are not welcomed in this acre of the world.' [[Shortly]], a path cleared between the ShadowLander and the owner of the high pitched voice. The voice belonged a squat little [[Nobbit]]. [[He]] sat with a crooked smile on his smiling face while his hand played with the handle of his jeweled dagger-like sword. On his throat, just above his massive goiter, he openly wore a staff shaped tattoo. [[Only]] true herdsmen wore these. A hush fell over the tavern. No one dared to draw breath.

The lone stranger turned towards the herdsman, still quaffing his grog. A bloodshot eye stared out from under his dark mask. A nervous twitch pulled at the muscle of his leathery cheek. '[[Ha]]!' laughed the herdsman as he waddled up to the bar, 'I do not believe the tall tales told of the ShadowLanders'. I believe them to be lies! I think they have less than half the warrior's blood that flows through my little toe!' The [[Nobbit]] snorted at his own remark, but looked disappointed when the others did not laugh with him. [[He]] turned back and stared at the stranger straight in the knee. 'For those who do not believe this, I will prove it by shedding some yellow DarkLander blood!'  
  
[[Quickly]], he drew his great dagger-like sword. [[Before]] the [[Nobbit]] could strike, the stranger grabbed the herdsman by the tattoo, and easily lifted him into the air. [[As]] the [[Nobbit]] began to open his mouth to cry out, the DarkLander shoved his massive fist down the herdsman's gullet. The stranger took a quick pull, and turned the [[Nobbit]] in-side-out. [[He]] dropped the bloody mess on the bar. Upon seeing this, some one gave the ancient herdsman warning cry; '[[Let]] us move the flock out of here!' The tavern was instantly cleared.

The lone stranger dismounted from his mammoth hordax, shaking the heavy drops from his cloak. The cave he had entered was small, its capacity barely providing shelter for his beast from the deluge that poured from the angry sky outside. [[He]] ventured deeper into the cavern to find room enough to remove his rain soaked garments. Stepping through a stony portal, he found himself suddenly bathed in the warm glow of a tallow fed lantern. Upon his entry into the cave seven pairs of shocked eyes turned in his direction.  
  
'[[Argh]]! A thief is here to take our gems!' cried one of the little men as he thrust his shovel in the stranger's direction. 'You try it, and I'll cut your eyes out and feed them to the snails!' '[[Hold]] your blade, you grumpy old fool!' called one of the others, 'this nice man might be here to help us.' '[[Nice]] man?' retorted the other, '[[If]] you were not such a dopey twit you would recognize him as a ShadowLander. [[He]] helps no one but himself.' 'What shall we do, [[Doc]]?' call one of the others, too bashful to show his face in the light. The small man who appeared to be in charge stepped forward to size up the stranger. 'Well, judging from all that trouble we had with that female a while back, I'd say we could save ourselves a pack of trouble and just put a pick up side his head right now!'  
  
[[Suddenly]], six shadowy figures leapt forwards. [[In]] a flash, the lone stranger's dark blade appeared in his hands. Quietly, it whistled through calm air, practicing its deadly craft. [[In]] the blink of an eye, six small heads fell cleft from six small frames. The last midget, the one slowest in wit, made a tasty morsel for the stranger's hordax...
