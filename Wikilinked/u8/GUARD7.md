Guardsman! 
Run for your very life! The [[Titans]] seek vengeance! 
Find shelter before the quakes consume you! We must stop the walking dead from overrunning the city! 
What now? 
What do you want? 
More questions? 
What do you want, stranger? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
Bye 
None of your concern! 
Guarding the [[Tempest]]. 
What! Are you blind? You are standing in the palace of the [[Tempest]]. 
I really should be about my duties anyway. 
If the stories hold any truth, thanks for helping [[Devon]] gain the rule of [[Tenebrae]]. He is much more tolerant than [[Mordea]] was.
