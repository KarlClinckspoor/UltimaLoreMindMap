[[Tarna]]
guard 
Run, you fool! The [[Titans]] have been angered. No one is safe from their wrath. 
Be off with you. There is no time for conversation when the walking dead march upon the city! 
Goodbye. 
I told you to move along! Bother me with your questions later. 
Hello, [[Tarna]]. 
Hello. 
What is your name? 
Greetings, 
.
Greetings. 
I am [[Tarna]], guardswoman of [[Tenebrae]]. Please tell me what it is you wish to know so that I might get on with my business. 
Tell me about your job. 
Tell me about [[Tenebrae]]. 
A chat. 
Information. 
You are, of course, staying out of trouble I trust, 
You are, of course, staying out of trouble I trust. 
Have you stopped me to chat or for more information? 

Waste not my time! If you have need to speak, then do so. 
Be off! 
I am sorry but I have not the time for such pleasantries. Good day. 
I have no time to talk. Now that the [[Theurgists]] have lost their healing powers, the guards are on extra duty to insure no trouble breaks out. 
I am sorry, but with the change in rule, I am too busy dealing with [[Devon]] to answer your questions. 
Who is [[Orlok]]? 
What information would you like? Surely by now you have seen enough of the city to have learned where everything is. Or was the Shattered Skull too busy for [[Orlok]] to tell you one of his tales? 
[[Orlok]] is the bartender at the tavern. Though his stories are rather long on time and short on truth, they are quite entertaining. And, better yet, he fills his tankards to the top. However, watch how many you have. If you cause too much trouble, you might get thrown out -- if not by Jenna, then by me. 
Where is the tavern? 
Who is Jenna? 
It is in the Southwest part of town. 'Tis hard to miss, it's such a large building. 
The barmaid? She is the daughter of the Captain of the Guard. She is feisty -- more like her father than he would care to admit. Judging the likes of you, she would come out the better in a fight. 
I suppose that should not be too difficult, since I have lived here my entire life. Some say [[Tenebrae]] does not need to be anything more than a bastion of security, since there is no other measure of civilization around, but I disagree. Give me my home and my blade and I'll protect her -- [[Tenebrae]] -- with my life. 
Bastion of security from what? 
No other measure? 
Well, initially, from the [[Zealans]]. That is why the city is divided into three sections. The rulers wanted addition defenses for the palace should the outer walls be breached.  Now, however, the walls are little more than divisions between the decent people and	the Necromancers. Not to, ah, imply that you or the Necromancers are -indecent- or any such thing, of course.

Now, however, the walls are nothing more than divisions between the classes and boundaries for the weather... and the cemetery. 
Boundary for the weather? 
What about the cemetery? 
[[Zealans]]? 
Indeed, you are a stranger not to know of the despicable [[Zealans]]. They are, or -were-, an insane collection of people who were too blind to recognize the power of the [[Titans]]. They foolishly and tenaciously held on to an archaic set of beliefs, and when the [[Titans]] demonstrated their might and authority, the [[Zealans]] refused to acknowledge the truth. 
As long as we show proper reverence for The Lady [[Mordea]], she shall bless us with skies of peace and calm. Cross her, however, and she shall call upon the might of [[Hydros]], raining down upon the people a tempest the likes of which have never been felt before. Yet the Lady does not extend her kindness without the city walls, traveler beware. 
'Tis home to more than the dead it is. In accordance with our pact, we bring the lifeless corpses of our friends and brethren to the Necromancers there, and only they and [[Lithos]] know what happens after that. 
What pact? 
Tell me about the Necromancers. 
Eons ago, our forebears formed a covenant with [[Lithos]]. He would cease his angry rumblings if we agreed to send our dead to him. There, deep in the heart of [[Pagan]], the dead exist solely to serve the [[Mountain King]]'s very wishes. And sometimes, [[Lithos]] has them wander the surface world as well! 
How do you send the dead? 
Wander up here? 
Aye, in the cemetery the undead wander, doing the bidding of the Necromancers, always ready to take the living down to the very depths of the [[Mountain King]]'s domain. I would avoid the cemetery at all costs, I would.  Keep your business far from there. 
How in the blazes do you expect me to know? Burying them does it I suppose.  Why not ask a [[Necromancer]]? 
I'll tell you what I can. They say Necromancers deal with death. Well, I say that is not true -- Necromancers -are- death as far as I am concerned! I suppose someone must be responsible for maintaining our end of the pact, but how anyone can choose to do so willingly is beyond my comprehension. 
Well, we've seen neither hide nor hair of another community, save the mages. 
The mages? 
Aye. The healers and the [[Sorcerers]]! 
Describe the healers. 
What [[Sorcerers]]? 
They call themselves [[Theurgists]] -- whatever -that- means. All I know is that they provide a valuable service to us here in the city, so I care not how it is done. I am grateful they do not require that we head to their home, [[Argentrock Isle]], for such help. I consider it only too kind that the healers are willing to travel here. 
How do the [[Theurgists]] arrive? 
A good question, that one, and one for which I have no answer. Rumor tells of magical devices that permit all the mages to teleport about [[Pagan]], but I have seen no such thing, myself. 
Ah, the black ones, followers of the [[Lord of Flame]]. The Necromancers may deal with death, but oft times I wonder whether the followers of [[Pyros]] are not the true representatives of evil. I do know this: Ask not too many questions of the Town [[Sorcerer]], [[Beren]], for our peace with him is tenuous at best. 
I see. Very well, 'tis my lot to take care of my fellow Tenebraens, though I suspect that would include you as well, so long as you stay out of trouble. I keep the peace within and the war without, if you know what I mean. 
The war without? 
What about the executions? 
Well, I suppose that would seem a bit obscure -now-. However, 'twas not that long ago when the [[Zealans]] still attempted to scale our walls. Of course, the raids actually ceased nearly a century ago, but defending the city from invaders is still an integral part of a guard's training! 
What are [[Zealans]]? 
They were part of maintaining order under [[Mordea]]'s iron grip. I am glad there are fewer under [[Devon]]'s rule. 
What about them? They are a necessary part of maintaining order. Nothing more, but nothing less. 
Halt! I have never seen you before, stranger. Identify yourself and your business in [[Tenebrae]]. 
I go by 
What just happened here? 
The execution is none of your business. Just be glad that a treasonous, despicable criminal has been properly punished. 
Now answer the question! 
I come in peace. 
My business, not yours. 
I do not remember. 
Well now, that's a little more like it. 
Well met, 
And where do you hail from? 
The beach. 
A place far away. 
Another world. 
Yes. 
No. 
I said, not your concern! 
'Tis good to hear, stranger. I am certain that will not change. Do not prove me wrong, stranger. 
Now tell me, where do you hail from? 
If you truly believe that, then you are sadly mistaken. For every moment you spend in [[Tenebrae]], what you are doing and where you are doing it is exactly my business as guard of the royal household! Now I repeat, state your name and business. 
You won't last long here with an attitude like that. For the final time, will you tell me your name and business here in [[Tenebrae]]? 
Well, what is it then? 
Then prepare to answer to my blade! 
Had a bit too much of [[Orlok]]'s brew, eh? Well, you just watch yourself and stay out of trouble, and we'll have no quarrel with you. 
A fisherman, then? You do not dress like one who makes his living pulling nets from the sea. Then your business in the city is...? 
I do not know. 
To return home. 
To leave this place. 
To make money. 
Another island? I admit your clothing is unusual, but I was not aware there were other cities. Well, I suggest you quickly learn the laws and customs of -this- city. What is your business in the city? 
I may appear to be just a simple guard to you, but I outgrew such fairytales years ago. I suggest you change your tone with me or I will see your worthless hide resting on the inside of a jail! Now, if you would, tell me your business in the city. 
Well you had best find out, 
. We do not like trouble in the city.
Well you had best find out, stranger. We do not like trouble in the city. 
You may go about your business. Please move along and do not disturb the widow until after I have escorted her from the docks. 
Then what in the Lady's name are you doing wandering around here? I suggest you quickly find your way. 
Whose business is not? While you are at it, buy yourself some better attire.
