[[One]] day a man named [[Jely]] came across a piece of cheese. [[At]] first, he knew not what to make of this piece of aged milk. [[So]] he pondered over it for some time. [[He]] then gave it a sniff. Mmmm, delightful it was. The scent was quite pleasing, somewhat like a strained fart. [[But]] a dark thought grew in the back of [[Jely]]'s head. 'What whould it taste like.' he thought. [[Never]] is anything as bad tasting as it smells. 'CHOMP! Mmmmm' [[It]] tasted very good. Then [[Jely]] noticed the heat began to rise. '[[Whew]]! Damn hot today.' [[Jely]] began to sweat. The moral of the story... Eat [[Cheese]] and [[Perspire]]!
