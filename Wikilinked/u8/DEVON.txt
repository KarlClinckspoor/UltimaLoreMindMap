[[Devon]]
fisherman 
man 
What are you doing there...? 
Beren! I am assaulted! 
[[Oh]] dear, 
. [[It]] seems quite a stir has been created. I hope you are well.
. For a moment I thought you were one of the ghouls who seem to have begun wandering the city. I am glad to see you are alive.
Hello there, 
.
Hello there. 
What is going on? 
Greetings, [[Devon]]. 
I need the [[Blackrock]] fragment. 
Hello, [[Devon]]. 
The [[Lurker]] is free! 
Who are you? 
Goodbye. 
I am [[Devon]], my strange friend. [[And]] I am glad to see you are feeling better, 
Where am I? 
Where did you find me? 
[[How]] do you know my name? 
Why, on the shore, friend, safe now and thankfully alive. 
What happened to me? 
Shore of what? 
Shore of what? Why, the shore of [[Tenebrae]], upon the Sea of Rains. 
[[Tenebrae]]? 
Sea of Rains? 

[[Oh]]. I am sorry. I thought you were still speaking to me. 
I see you otherwise occupied. I shall not waste any more of your time. Farewell. 
Obviously you do not spend any time away from the city to ask such a question. Why, 'tis nothing more than the name of the sea. The story goes that the rains are quite heavy the farther you go from the shore. [[It]] is supposed to have something to do with [[Mordea]]'s powers. Part of her role as ruling [[Tempest]] is to control the rain over the city, but she feels no obligation to extend that in the distant waters. Of course, I have never had an unwanted cloud while out to sea, myself, so I suspect the name is more rumor than truth. 
Aye, [[Tenebrae]], the [[City]] of Eternal Twilight. They say you'll never find a more lovely place and I do not disagree, save for one place. [[But]] I will say this, the farther I am from the [[Lady]], the better I feel. I can tell by your questions that you are not from this land. [[Come]] you from another island? Or perhaps some place that is an even greater distance away. 
What is the lovelier place? 
Who is the [[Lady]]? 
I am from far away. 
I suspected as much, my friend, for your questions are most unusual. I must inform you that, a simple fisherman, I am a poor source of information about our local customs and such. I am sure there must be someone else who can tell you more. Why, I know just the person. When you get to town, visit [[Bentic]] in the library in east [[Tenebrae]]. [[My]] good friend knows practically all there is to know about our land and its people. [[Yes]], he can certainly help you. 
Why, the open sea, of course! I can think of nothing more reassuring than the smell of the salt and the feel of a taut net as it fills with fish. [[And]] the weather! I hear others complain it is as fickle as the [[Lady]], but I know no such thing. I can think of no day on the sea when the sky was not clear and the waves as gentle as a baby's hand. 
You mean the [[Lady]] [[Mordea]], my friend. [[She]] is [[Tempest]] and ruler of the city. Others call her a tyrant in whispered corners, though I held no opinion myself. Until recently, that is. 
What is a [[Tempest]]? 
What changed your opinion? 
Lately the [[Lady]] has taken to eliminating dissension by eliminating the dissenters. [[She]] has them executed, beheaded on the docks. [[At]] first no one was killed but true criminals, but soon, any who showed disagreement was put to the block. I fear for the freedom of the people. 
[[Indeed]], you ask unusual questions. [[However]], I know so little about them, myself. [[In]] town you might find others who can offer so much more assistance. 
Found me? 
I am unsure, my friend. All I know is that I found your water-logged body in the depths of The [[Lurker]]'s domain. What happened before remains a mystery. I pulled in my nets and within one I discovered you. 
The [[Lurker]]'s domain? 
Aye, 'tis what we sometimes call the sea. You were drowning in it, my friend. A fate twice bad to be certain! 
What is the [[Lurker]]? 
Twice bad? 
Aye! [[Not]] only would it have meant death for you, but then you would have been doomed to walk the ocean floor, unable to fulfill the pact with [[Lithos]]. 
What pact? 
Who is [[Lithos]]? 
[[Ages]] ago, our people forged a covenant with [[Lithos]]. [[If]] he would still the shaking earth, we would commend to him our dead at the time of their passing. 
Commend to him? 
Rules death? 
Through his [[Necromancers]], [[Lithos]] takes the dead to serve him for the remainder of their existence. 
Who are the [[Necromancers]]? 
I am amazed at how little you know, friend. The [[Necromancers]] are the keepers of the cemetery. They have the rather distasteful duty of burying the dead, thus honoring the pact and sending the dead to [[Lithos]]. 
We call him the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. [[He]] rules the grass, the stones, the hills -- all that we walk upon. [[He]] also rules death. 
The [[Lurker]]? [[That]] is our name for [[Hydros]], [[Titan]] of water. [[She]] is a crafty and treacherous one, always ready to pull unwilling victims to their deaths at the depths of the sea... much like what nearly happened to you. 
I am sorry. I did not mean to pry, but when I found you, I knew not who you were. I am afraid I read through your logbook and discovered your name. [[Please]] forgive me. 
[[Good]] day. 
All is well, I hope. 
Hail, friend. 
Any news? 
What should I do? 
I was just about to ask you the same, friend. Nay, there is nothing new to tell. 'Tis a shame about [[Toran]], though, is it not? 
What about [[Toran]]? 
Who is [[Toran]]? 
Nay, there is nothing new to tell. There has been little else on my mind than undoing what [[Mordea]] had wrought with her tyranny. 
[[Only]] that [[Mordea]] was more corrupt than I ever thought possible. I am spending all of my time undoing her wrongs. 
[[As]] a simple fisherman, I never wanted the life of a ruler. I always believed it would be a difficult and troublesome position. [[Now]] that I -am- responsible for the citizens of [[Tenebrae]], I am certain of the difficuties and troubles. 
I was just about to ask you the same, friend. Nay, there is nothing new to tell. 
I was just about to ask you the same, friend. Nay, there is nothing new to tell. [[But]] perhaps [[Bentic]]'s eyes and ears have observed up some information of importance. 
A good man, he was. [[Toran]] was the gemcutter. [[His]] works were quite good. I can tell you, his wife and son are quite distraught. Who can blame them? 
[[His]] wife? 
[[His]] son? 
A good man, I would say. [[He]] is the gemcutter. [[His]] works are considered quite good. 
[[Ah]], [[Poor]] [[Rhian]]. [[She]] did not handle the execution well. They had been married for more than 20 years. All she does now is sit by her loom and weep, so I hear tell. Pity. 
[[His]] son does not handle grief like his mother. [[Torwin]] has decided to take matters into his own hands. I hear he has joined the [[Order]] of [[Enlightenment]], though his impetuous nature may give him difficulties. [[Perhaps]] with hard work he will persevere. 
[[His]] son does not handle grief like his mother. [[Torwin]] has decided to take matters into his own hands, though only the [[Titans]] know what he will do. I suppose violence would not be out of the question. I can only hope that is not the case, for even if he could get past the guards, [[Mordea]]'s abilities are more than adequate to stave off his assault. 
[[He]] was killed, he was. Executed at the [[Lady]]'s command. I know the reasons they gave, but [[Toran]] was no blasphemer. There is tyranny in this city, that's for sure. [[Be]] careful what you speak to others.

All I am concerned about now is pacifying the [[Lurker]], my friend. I am sorry, but I have no time for anything else. 
Well, I suppose now that you are better, you should consider visiting [[Tenebrae]]. Here there is nothing, unless you wish to join me in fishing. [[But]] in [[Tenebrae]], there is a wealth of activities and information for a soul such as yourself. Why, I know just the person there who can help you. When you get to town, visit [[Bentic]] in the library in east [[Tenebrae]]. The good sage knows practically all there is to know about our land and its people. [[Yes]], he can certainly help you. 
Farewell, friend 
, and good luck.
, and good luck. You are welcome to stay with me for as long as you need. [[My]] food and provisions are yours until you wish to head to the city. [[And]] be careful in your travels, for I fear you will encounter much violence.
I can already see a crowd gathering there on the docks.
[[That]] can mean only trouble.
I am not sure, my friend, though I must admit I am pleased to see you.  [[My]] good friend, [[Bentic]], has been... executed. [[And]] I, myself, jailed. Yet no one will tell me why. Why, 
. Why are these needless deaths happening? [[Please]], 
, you must find this out for me. I beg your assistance. What was [[Bentic]] doing that warranted death? Certainly [[Salkind]] has some explanation. [[He]] will not speak to me here, but perhaps you will find him in kind enough spirits to answer a few questions.
I will help. 
I am sorry. 
You are sorry? I understand. You are too busy with your own troubles. 
[[At]] the moment, I can offer you only my eternal gratitude. [[But]] I hope one day to repay you for the kindness and courage you are sharing. [[Good]] luck, my friend. 
Well met, friend. I hope your luck is holding out. I do not know how much longer they will keep me here, and I fear the chopping block is not out of the question. [[Please]], continue with your quest. 
You will forgive me if I do not respond politely. The bitter taste left in my mouth from our last encounter is quite foul. Unless you are here to offer assistance, please be on your way. 
I will assist you. 
Farewell. 
Begone, coward. 
I cannot tell you how pleased I am to see your change of heart. I found it difficult to so often curse the name of one I knew to be kind and courageous. [[At]] the moment, I can but offer you my eternal gratitude. [[But]] I hope one day to repay you for your deeds. [[Good]] luck, my friend. 
I am sorry, my friend, but for once it is me who does not understand you. What is this [[Blackrock]] fragment? 
The [[Tear]] of the [[Seas]]. 
Who would know its location? 
To answer that, I must know what it is you are talking about. 
I have not heard of this item.  What exactly is this [[Blackrock]] [[Tear]]? 
[[It]] is a large, dark stone. 
Your description is rather vague. Considering the once-active state of the volcano, I do not think you will get far asking for a large black-colored rock. I would even be suprised if -- wait! Despite my words I might be able to assist you. [[Years]] ago, I found myself casting my nets in a new area. The catch was plentiful, I remember, and when I pulled in my nets one time, I found such a stone within. The rock was made of an unusually hard substance, even more resistant than obsidian. I thought it so peculiar at the time that I kept it. I still have it if you wish to see it.
[[Yes]], I do. 
No, I do not. 
May you farewell. 
I believe it is locked away in a chest in my study, in the southwest corner of the palace. Here is the key. You may take it for whatever purpose you need.~ [[Oh]], yes, there is something else I wanted to mention to you. You have been here for sometime and yet I do not know where you have managed to find accomodations. The least I can do is have you stay at [[Salkind]]'s house. There you should find food and lodging, and most likely even a little money. You have done so much for the city, I feel that we owe you no less.
I hope this key helps. 
Very well, though I find it odd that you mentioned it then. Should you change your mind, I believe it is locked away in a chest in my study, in the southwest corner of the palace. Here is the key.

Goodbye, 
, and good luck!
While terrible as that might be, I am more concerned with my current situation. [[Perhaps]] later, my friend, I will be more interested in that. 
I had feared as much. When the torrential rains began and the people came to me, I could not stop it. Then I knew something was wrong. [[At]] first, I had hopes that you simply found another [[Tempest]], one who was older. Yet somehow	I knew, I felt, that was not the case. Tell me, friend, how did this come to pass? 
Twas my fault. 
I know not. 
[[That]] does not surprise me. [[From]] the day I cut you free of my fishing nets, I knew of the luck that followed you. Whether it is good luck or bad I did not know. Nor, for that matter, am I sure now. Nevertheless, the rains must cease or the land will flood again, as in the days of [[Kalen]] and the wars with the [[Zealans]]. [[And]], my friend, I believe it is up to you to end this cataclysm. Though I am loath to suggest this, perhaps the [[Sorcerers]] who dwell across the river of lava in the catacombs can help. 
This is terrible. With [[Hydros]] free and the rain falling in torrents, the land will surely flood. We have not the time nor the ability to move to the safety of higher ground!
