monk 
man 
What are you doing there...? 
[[Stratos]]! Preserve me! 
Excuse me? 
Can I help you? 
Ask if you need something! 
What do you want? 
Where is that old man? 
hmmmm... 
Studying is such a waste of my time. 
Where is that book...? 
I know it is here somewhere... 
I need to sit down... 
I don't know why I put up with this. 
I must meditate! 
I can't concentrate! 
Excuse me! 
[[Yes]]? 
Humph. [[Some]] people...! 
[[Do]] you mind? 
I must speak with [[Cyrrus]]. 
hmmmm...  
heh, heh... 
Where is that focus? 
Damn... 
I feel tired. 
I should take a walk. 
I am 
.
[[My]] name is 
Excuse me 
Will you be wasting more of my time? 
What do you want this time? 
I haven't much time. What do you need? 
Hello, [[Torwin]]. 
[[Is]] your name not [[Torwin]]? 
I need healing 
I have completed the [[Tests]]. 
[[Have]] I met you before? 
I don't believe we have met. 
[[Torwin]]!
Go away, leave me alone! 
Someone's [[Focus]] is missing. 
bye 
[[Oh]], I'm very bad with names. What was yours again? 
You don't need to know. 
[[Yes]], my name is [[Torwin]]. I'm very bad with names. What was yours again? 
[[Yes]], well, I probably won't remember it next time I see you. What do you want? 
What do you do here? 
Someone's focus is missing. 
[[My]] name is [[Torwin]]. [[And]] yours? 
Well, anyway, hello, 
. What brings you here?
For now I am only a healer. [[But]] that is just because they have not recognized my superior abilities, but they will. Believe me, they will. 
You are a healer? 
What superior abilities? 
Who will recognize your abilities? 
Why, my talent for magic, of course. I've passed all the tests, faster than anyone ever has before...and anyone ever will, I'm sure. 
[[Everyone]], of course. I never make an error when I am casting the magic. I even constructed my foci correctly on the very first try. [[And]] it is the finest of all the foci, I might add. 
What is a [[Focus]]? 
[[Oh]], I could explain it, but I doubt you would understand. [[It]]'s very complicated, magic and all. 
[[Yes]], why else would I be here? Anyway, are you in need of healing? 
aye 
nay 
[[If]] you are going to be rude, then I shall not take the time to assist you. 
What? You look healthy enough to me! Begone! I do not have the time nor the patience for hangnails and paper cuts! 
Wimp! 
Actually, I'm relieved, for I do not wish to take precious time away from my studies. No one here has the raw talent and ability I have. [[And]], I will suffer no one to surpass me. I -must- be the best, I -will- be the best! [[Now]], if you will excuse me. 
What?! [[That]] is not possible! No one has ever completed the tests faster than I! I will not stand for this! 
A missing focus? I know nothing about this matter. 
I believe you do. 
I know nothing, I tell you. Why I haven't even been near [[Brother]] Xavier! 
[[But]] you knew it was [[Brother]] Xavier. 
Well, I didn't steal it. I only meant to borrow it. 
[[Did]] not steal it? 
[[Only]] borrowed it? 
I told you, I'm not a thief! 
I needed the magic in it for my father. 
the magic in it? 
your father? 
Foci are very strong lines to the great [[Stratos]]. I thought that perhaps with two, I might be able to draw twice as much power from the great [[Air]] [[Titan]]. 
[[Yes]], my father. [[His]] name is....er,..was [[Toran]]. [[He]] lived in [[Tenebrae]], my home town. [[He]]'s dead now, killed by that evil [[Mordea]]. 
[[Toran]] was your father? 
Why did [[Mordea]] kill him? 
[[Yes]]. [[He]] was a good man, not afraid to speak out for what he believed...and he was killed for it. 
[[That]] murdering bitch! [[She]] had him executed for simply speaking his mind. [[Is]] that right? Can a man's life be snuffed out for mere words? [[Is]] that right, I ask you!? 
I saw his execution. 
[[Mordea]] is dead. 
Then you saw as his head was severed from his body with the single swing of the executioner's ax. [[In]] that instant, the most important man in my life was taken from me, and I could do nothing about it... not then anyway. 
You could do nothing? 
You could do nothing about it? 
I could do nothing, just as I could do nothing to stop you surpassing my deeds here at [[Argentrock]]. Until you arrived, I was the quickest learner and the most clever with the magic. You stole that from me, but I will still have my revenge. No, that is mine and mine alone. [[Do]] you hear me? 
revenge 
[[She]] is dead? This can not be! I was to kill her! ~You have stolen from me every thing. I was the best student here until you arrived. ~I was the quickest learner and the cleverest with the magic. ~You stole that from me, and now you have stolen my revenge! 
I will still have my revenge! I will bring my father back to life! I will bring him back from the [[[[Pit]] of [[Death]]]]! 
Your father is with the [[Lurker]]. 
YOU LIE! [[He]] is in the [[[[Pit]] of [[Death]]]] and I SHALL BRING HIM BACK! [[Do]] you hear? I shall! [[And]] I shall do it now! 
Why, I don't need this extra focus at all! 
I am strong enough to do it on my own... 
[[And]] I will! I'm coming for you, father!! 
[[Torwin]], wait! 
[[Not]] then, but with what I have learned here, I will be able to make things right again! 
[[How]] will you make things right? 
I will use the magic from [[Stratos]] to bring my father back to life. I will have my revenge! 
Goodbye.
