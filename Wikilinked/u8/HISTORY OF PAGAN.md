([[False]] history)  
  
[[Long]] ago, before the time in which the [[Titans]] came to the world, there were people who were vile and unclean. These people called themselves [[Zealans]] and they worshipped their own emotions and therefore tried to make themselves as gods. Then came a man named [[Kalen]] who saw that such behaviour was false and an affront to nature. [[Kalen]] preached to the people that they should not set themselves above the natural forces who are eternal and more powerful than man.  
  
[[In]] time, people began to see the wisdom in [[Kalen]]'s words and followed his teachings. These people called themselves [[Pagans]] and they turned aside from the worship of emotions. [[In]] time, those who followed the old worship of emotions, those who were called [[Zealans]] began to hate the [[Pagans]]. For the [[Pagans]], the practitioners of the one true church had begun to grow strong in their numbers. The [[Zealans]] feared that the [[Pagans]] would overwhelm them. Then did the [[Zealans]] persecute the [[Pagans]].  
  
Though persecuted, the [[Pagans]] continued to spread the word of the power of the natural forces, and the divinity therein. Because of the danger of being killed or enslaved by [[Zealans]], the [[Pagans]] were driven out of the cities and into the wilderness. [[Kalen]] then took his followers up to the peak of the great mountain, [[Morgaelin]]. There they built a great altar where they could worship the forces of nature in peace. The construction of the altar took a very long time, for it was built from a sacred black stone that is very rare.  
  
[[Not]] long after the altar was built, the [[Zealans]] attacked the [[Pagans]] so that the true religion would be driven out of the world. [[However]], the natural divinities saw that that their children were being assailed and were saddened. [[In]] the ensuing battle, the [[Zealan]] soldiers drove the [[Pagans]] before them and seemed to the peaceful to be unstoppable. [[But]] in one great act of blasphemy, the [[Zealans]] destroyed the [[Holy]] [[Altar]] which the [[Pagans]] had built. [[In]] one great blast of foul magic, the altar was shattered. [[Its]] many pieces were scattered about the mountain top.  
  
[[Seeing]] such blasphemy, the natural divinities came down from the heavens and destroyed the [[Zealan]] army. [[After]] the battle, the natural divinities saw that what had once been a place of holy worship had now been defiled by [[Zealan]] hatred. Therefore, the natural divinities destroyed the top of the mountain, and exposed a seething volcano. When the natural divinities saw that [[Kalen]] had been killed and that the [[Pagans]] had no leader, they decided to liven up the world. The divinities then manifested themselves as the [[Titans]] of the elements and poured out their wrath upon the [[Zealans]]. When the [[Pagans]] lost their way and did not give proper thanks and worship to the [[Titans]], they too received the [[Titans]]' wrath.
