Guardsman! 
Run for your life! The [[Titans]] have gone insane! 
We are doomed! The walking dead march upon the city! 
What now? 
What can I do for you? 
[[Do]] you have nothing better to do than think of questions all day? 
What do you want, stranger? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
Bye 
Who are you to ask me such? 
'Tis I who should demand your name, cur! 
[[My]] job is to guard to watch out for odds folks like you. 
You are in the palace. 
What makes you think I have time for this kind of talk? 
Continue on your way before I decide to put you away. 
About time. 
[[By]] the way, rumor has it you had something to do with getting rid of [[Mordea]]. 
Between you and me -- thanks!
