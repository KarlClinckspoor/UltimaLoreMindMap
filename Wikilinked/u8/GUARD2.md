dead guardsman 
guardsman 
Guardsman! 
The [[Titans]] are angry! Run to safety and pray for their mercy! 
For the sake of [[Lithos]], we are beset by the dead! Find shelter, stranger. 
What is it now? 
What do you want? 
What! Again with questions! 
What do you want, stranger? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
Bye 
My name is none of your concern. What -is- your concern is staying out of trouble. 
My duty is to protect the [[Tempest]], [[Devon]], though I doubt he needs it with his powers. 
My duty is to protect her Ladyship, [[Mordea]], though I doubt she needs it with her powers. You would have to be insane to think of assaulting her. 
Try to listen this time! 
You are in central [[Tenebrae]]. 
This direction leads to the palace. 
Since you're new here I'd suggest you stay clear of it! 
It is a quiet place without [[Mordea]]. 
You should head east or west, for the palace holds only trouble for the likes of you. 
To the East is where the rich folks live. 
On that side is a library and a weapons trainer. 
And that is where all the poor sods live. 
There is the smithy and a tavern in that direction as well. 
I must be getting back to duty, now. Mayhaps later we'll meet at the Shattered Skull. 
Now, move along so I can return to duty. 
I go back to duty now.
