JOURNAL OF VERAS THE HEALER  
  
[[My]] dearest [[Prevan]], I regret to tell you that I will not be home from this visit as soon as I had thought. [[My]] healing services will be needed here for some time as a terrible thing has happened to this small village. Two nights ago, as I had just finished my evening rituals, I heard a horrible commotion from the town square. I ran out to see what the trouble was, only to find the town overrun by trolls. The trolls had come in search of their favorite meal, human children.  
  
[[From]] house to house they went, ripping doors off and brushing aside the men as if they were no more than flies. Mothers wailed as babes were torn from their breasts and fathers cried in anguish as one by one their children were eaten alive. The bloody procession went on and on, and I fear the screams and sobs will ring in my darkest dreams forever.[[And]] then, a miracle occured. [[From]] the final house, came not a cry of torment, but one of victory. We raced down the street to the house. We found the inside strewn with the bodies of the trolls and there in the middle stood [[Nehdra]], a young woman who had just given birth a few days before. [[She]] had her newborn clutched in one arm, in the other was a magnificent golden sword.  
  
[[She]] told us that as the trolls burst in, she had grabbed the only weapon she had, a knitting needle, and had cried out to [[Stratos]] to protect her child. Instantly, in answer to her plea, the great [[Stratos]] turned the needle into a magnificent sword. [[She]] said the sword fairly danced in her hand, slaying the trolls left and right until none were left alive.While I can find some solace in the miracle [[Stratos]] performed, I am afraid the task ahead of me is almost overwhelming. I do what I can to ease the hurts, but wounds of the mind [[Stratos]] gives no power to heal.  
  
I will stay until I have done all I can, then I will carry the sword, now called '[[Nehdra]]'s [[Needle]]' to [[Argentrock]] [[Isle]]. There I will prepare a small shrine for it in the catacombs beneath the monastery.I do miss you, my love, and ask that you watch over our dear little [[Stellos]] until I can return. [[It]] is sad his mother must be away from him so soon after his birth, but I must serve where I am needed. I am sure you understand. All my love, [[Veras]]
