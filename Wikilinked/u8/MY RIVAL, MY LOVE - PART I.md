MY RIVAL, MY LOVE - PART I  
A [[Shadowy]] [[Jester]] [[Book]], [[By]] [[Elise]]  
  
[[It]] all started when I met the one and only man who had the ability to make me question what I once regarded to be sound ideals. I never was a religious person; perhaps that was due to the fact that I was never an insecure person. I have always believed that people that are insecure turn to their gods for guidance, love, and protection. I never needed that. [[Never]], that is, until [[Alain]] walked into my life.  
  
I had been sewing a new gown for the season party when I realized I had broken my last needle. I had no choice but to find the tailor and purchase new needles from him. I had never been to his shop, and felt nervous about going there. We were rivals for I, too, made my living sewing clothing. When I got to his shop, I found the door pulled closed, but not latched. I let myself in and looked around. There was no one present. I took advantage of the moment and looked at what could very easily put me out of business. I knew that the only way to save my job, my LIFE!, was to destroy all of his work, thereby bringing all of his customers to me.  
  
[[As]] I proceeded to rip seams and remove buttons, I heard what I thought to be a door creaking. I turned around, and there he was, shining in all his glory. Lighting up the room with his golden blond hair, momentarily, I forgot where I was and what I was doing. I quickly dropped the gown I was demolishing and stood there slack- jawed. '[[Just]] what do you think you are doing?!' he melodically asked. 'I purchased this gown, and it was delivered to me in this state of disrepair,' I answered, frightened by the look on his face. '[[Oh]], no you did not purchase that gown, nor was it delivered to you in any state of repair or disrepair! I know who you are! You are [[Elise]], the [[Seamstress]], and I will not allow you in my shop! GET OUT!'  
  
[[He]] was beyond anger. I had never known anyone to act so irrationally over a silly piece of fabric, so I placed it down upon the table before me. '[[Do]] you really think that I am a [[Seamstress]]? [[How]] silly!' I was doing my best to convince him that I was not who he had accused me of being. 'I just came to your shop to look at your fashions, and perhaps employ you to sew a new gown for the season party.' I knew it wouldn't work, but I had no other choice but to flatter him. 'I don't believe you,' he said, staring deeply into my eyes. 'The reason I don't believe you is because I have watched you from afar, with joy in my heart and loathing in my soul. [[How]] can I love a woman whose very existence is my downfall?'  
  
[[His]] eyes were pleading now. 'I have looked upon you forever, it seems, and fought with myself constantly over my predicament.' [[He]] was coming closer to me now, and I could smell his manly scent. 'I didn't know how I should ever hope to meet you and then walk away, back to my own life without you...' [[He]] reached out to touch my arm and I pulled away, fearful of what his touch might do to me. Already I was heady with the excitement he was stirring in my empty soul. I was willing to do anything to keep him here before me, but I was fearful, for he was my rival, and I could not allow myself to love my fiercest competitor.  
  
'I must be going now,' a tiny, quivering voice said. Was that me? I had thought I was a far stronger person than what I was experiencing. I had once been so aware of my emotions and in control of my feelings, that the way I was feeling and reacting to him was completely alien to me. I looked at him, knowing that his feelings for me mirrored those burgeoning in me. [[He]] took me in his arms and his silken lips touched my forehead. 'I knew you would come here tonight,' his deep voice revealed. 'I wanted you to come here, and I knew that the only way to get you to do that was to bring about the breaking of your one and only needle,' he confessed.  
  
'[[But]] how did you...' 'I went to your house earlier today, when you were at the weaver's. I knew that the only way to get you to come here would be dishonest, but I no longer cared. I scored your needle so deeply that it would break when you set out to use it. [[Please]] forgive me, but it was the only way.' '[[Oh]], [[Alain]], I forgive you! [[Please]], please, don't regret what you have done, for it has brought me to you...'
