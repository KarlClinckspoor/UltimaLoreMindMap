[[Recorded]] on these pages are tips I have found while on my adventures. Read well, fellow quester, for your life may well be saved by recalling these in your time of need.  
  
[[Puzzles]]: You will be in luck if such puzzles are played with levers. These are usually not harmful, and require little time, if you watch your surroundings for clues. Center levers usually reset the puzzle. Traps: [[If]] there is a chest sitting innocently in the open, touch it not! Especially if it has many corpses around it! These are the other dolts who fell for it.  
  
[[Chests]] of [[Loot]]: [[Rarely]] do chests have anything in them. [[Open]] them at your risk. [[It]] will serve you well to carry a magic scroll to check for traps within these!  
  
[[Tricks]] of the [[Trixter]]: [[Judge]] them by their cover, for they read differently than other books...  
  
[[Mazes]]: Always mark your path! Use rocks or wood. [[Never]] bread crumbs! [[Beware]] of treasure! [[It]] is there to lead you from the path!  
  
[[Spell]] [[Chits]]: Always read the text on the outside of these scrolls to identify them. [[Once]] you have opened them, their magic will immediately be released upon reading.
