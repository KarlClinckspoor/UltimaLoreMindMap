THE MAGIC OF LOTHIAN  
  
[[My]] time above this ground draws nigh. [[My]] dearest lord, the [[Mountain]] [[King]] calls me, and I must go. [[Soon]] I shall shed this mortal coil and join [[Lithos]] for life ever lasting. Yet before I go I must fulfill my final charge as [[Necromancer]]. [[My]] final duty is this, my spell. The spell which shall by my addition to the magic of the [[Earthen]] [[Power]], may [[Lithos]] be praised. For time immorial, students of the power of [[Earth]] shall this spell learn.  
  
[[From]] my undead lips shall they hear how to coax the [[Lord]] of all [[Earth]] to shake [[His]] mighty body and make all fall before the user of [[Earthen]] [[Magic]]. To call [[Quakes]]; combine the sacred reagents of bone, wood, dirt, and blackmoor. Invoke the power of magic upon these reagents when enclosed within a bag. Then will you be enabled to call upon the power of [[Lithos]]. This then is my final act as [[Necromancer]]. I await the call of the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. Lothian, [[Necromancer]].
