[[Mountain]] [[King]], I call Your name. Save me from this interloper! 
Thank you, my friend. You have done good service this day. [[And]] your timing could not be better. For, as you can see, Lothian lies upon the altar barely clinging to life. For your service, I will grant you the boon which you did ask of me. I will introduce you to the [[Necromancer]]. [[But]] first, stand witness to the [[Ceremony]] of [[Eternity]]. For the time has come for Lothian and I to perform the ceremony. [[Please]] follow my instructions closely. Are you prepared, Lothian? 
All of my life I have prepared for this, Vividos. I beg you now, send me to the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. 
Very well, please, my friend, stand beside the altar. 
[[Please]] kneel before the [[Altar]] of Passage. 
[[Lord]] [[Lithos]], [[Mountain]] [[King]], eldest and mightiest of the four [[Titans]], we come forth to send your faithful servant Lothian into your waiting arms. Tell us now, [[Lord]] of the Underworld, does this, our sacrifice please you? 
[[Yes]], [[Lord]]! [[Take]] me! I am ready to greet you, [[Mountain]] [[King]]! 
[[Let]] all rejoice, for [[Lithos]] is pleased with this, our sacrifice. [[Now]], prepare to greet the ambassadors from [[Lithos]]' realm. 
[[Kal]] [[Corp]]
The dead now surround you, Lothian. Prepare yourself for your [[Lord]]. 
The grave opens before me! 
[[Be]] you cleansed for death. [[Lithos]] awaits you. 
Sweet dagger, I am your sheath. Wear me now, lovely blade! 
Go you now to the [[Mountain]] [[King]]! [[From]] life to death. [[From]] death to [[Lithos]]! 
Ex [[Ort]] [[Corp]]. [[Ort]] [[Des]] [[Lithos]]!
[[Now]] shall we bow in reverence of deeds here done, and to the awesome might of the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. 
All is done. Lothian may now join her lord. 
Arise, my friend. 
You may now greet the [[Necromancer]] my friend, for I am he. 
Vividos
Mage 
Hello? 
Can I help you? 
PRAISE LITHOS!! 
[[Do]] you require my assistance? 
Very well then... 
Blessed are the children of [[Lithos]]. 
[[Oh]], to be with [[Lithos]]. 
Ahh, the life of the [[Necromancer]]. 
The ground is cool and good today. 
I wonder...? 
What is my lord doing right now? 
[[Oh]] mighty [[Lithos]], forgive my fragility. 
[[My]], the undead are restless today. 
[[One]] can almost feel [[Moriens]]' presence in these walls. 
I do worry so... 
Powerful indeed is the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. 
Tred lightly here on holy ground. 
I do worry so...? 
There are so many people who do not show [[Lithos]] respect. 
I must read [[Moriens]] book again very soon. 
Hello again, my friend. 
[[Ah]], a stranger. [[Have]] you come to the tomb to learn? 
YOU!! You stole the [[Heart]] of [[Earth]]! You betrayed the [[Mountain]] [[King]] and now he has forsaken us!! [[He]] tears the land apart. [[He]] has sent his army of the dead to walk above the ground and it is all because of you!! Give the [[Heart]] of [[Earth]] back now and he may spare us. [[If]] not, all is lost. Go!! Get away from here and return to the [[Mountain]] [[King]] what is [[His]]!!! 

I have the dagger. 
[[How]] are you today, Vividos? 
Tell me of [[Lithos]]. 
What [[Tomb]]? 
[[Yes]], I'm here to learn. 
Learn about what? 
Farewell. 
What [[Tomb]]? Why -the- [[Tomb]]. The [[Tomb]] of [[Moriens]]. 
The [[Tomb]] of [[Moriens]]? 
[[Yes]]! [[Moriens]], the [[Great]] [[One]], was interred here, within these very walls. 
What do you mean by interred? 
[[Oh]] my! This is excellent news! Well, I shall teach you all about our mysteries and traditions. 
Traditions. 
[[Necromancer]]? 
What mysteries? 
Buried, then given over to [[Lithos]], the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. [[Long]] has it been since [[Moriens]] joined [[Lithos]]. 
[[How]] long has it been? 
Who is [[Lithos]]? 
What a jest you play, my friend! [[As]] if any one could not know of the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. [[How]] could a person live and not know of the [[Earth]] [[Titan]]? You have a sharp wit, friend. 
[[Oh]], generations ago, too many to count. [[Moriens]] is the ancient father of all [[Necromancers]]. 
Learn the way of the [[Necromancer]]. Learn our traditions and mysteries! 
Lothian is the current [[Necromancer]]. [[But]] you probably already knew that. 
I need to speak to the [[Necromancer]]. 
Lothian?
I am sorry but that is impossible. The [[Necromancer]] is very ill and she is not receiving anyone. 
[[She]]'s too sick to see me? 
[[Yes]]. [[In]] fact, she has been slipping in and out of consciousness lately. [[Even]] if you were to see her, she probably would not be awake. 
[[Long]] has she been the [[Necromancer]]. Lothian has loyally served since I was but a boy. 
[[Our]] lives are very structured. We must perform our rites very precisely lest they be not accepted. Yet sometimes such precision can create problems. 
[[Not]] accepted. 
What problems? 
I can not tell someone who is not of our order about our mysteries. You could learn all if you were to join the order and become a novice. 
Join your order? 
What is a novice? 
A novice is someone who has newly joined the order and has just begun to learn. 
Few people join our order. [[Life]] here is not easy but it is rewarding. 
[[As]] you are not of our order, I can not tell you much. Suffice to say that titanic forces are often fickle. 
[[Titanic]] forces? 
You have many questions, my friend! I was the same when first I came to the [[Tomb]]. Unfortunately, I can answer little since, as I have said, you are not of our order. 
[[As]] I said, in our rituals, everything must be done at the right time with the right tools. Unfortunately, we are missing a most important tool. 
Missing a tool? 
[[Yes]], our ceremonial dagger. [[It]] was taken from us by that power mad witch, [[Mordea]]. 
[[Power]] mad? 
[[Mordea]] took the dagger? 
[[Mordea]] is dead. 
[[Yes]]! [[Never]] before have we had to worry about such things. People have always feared the cemetery and respected our work. [[But]] not long ago, [[Mordea]] came here with an armed force and took the dagger. 
Why is this dagger special? 
People respected your work? 
[[Oh]] yes, we were respected and feared. The [[Necromancers]] have always been held in just regard as one of the great powers of the world. [[It]] has taken one so obsessed with power as [[Mordea]] to lessen the people's regard for us. 
People feared you? 
Your order is a great power? 
People's regard has lessened? 
[[It]] is only natural that people fear forces that they do not understand. Of course they have never had a reason to fear us. Those of our order have always been benevolent, unlike the followers of [[Pyros]] or the [[Lurker]]. 
[[Pyros]]? 
The [[Lurker]]? 
[[Please]], speak not of that malevolent demon! I should not have mentioned his name. All the world would he consume in his flame if he were allowed! 
[[Is]] [[Pyros]] a [[Titan]]? 
[[Please]], I asked you not to speak of him. 
The water [[Titan]]. Damned be her and all who follow her. [[That]] is [[Mordea]]'s station; to follow that watery spirit and oppress all in her way. 
What greater power could there be than the power of the land itself? We who follow the [[Mountain]] [[King]] are peaceful, but when we are pressed we can wield our power well. 
What about [[Mordea]]? 
[[It]] would do more harm than good for the [[Necromancer]] to wage war with [[Mordea]]. [[Even]] though [[Mordea]] is power mad. 
[[More]] harm than good? 
[[Yes]], I am sad to say. We shall yet win them back, however. [[Lithos]] will lead us out of these dark times and show to all [[His]] power and majesty. 
[[Power]] and majesty? 
You must understand that we do not seek to rule all, such as [[Mordea]] does. We simply wish all to respect and revere [[Lithos]]. 
Think of the destruction that would occur if two [[Titanic]] forces were to lock themselves in combat. The destruction would be terrible. 
[[It]] was given to [[Moriens]] by the [[Mountain]] [[King]] [[Himself]]. We can not perform our ceremonies with any other dagger. 
I don't care who hears me say it! [[Mordea]] is evil and power hungry! [[Long]] has she been a tyrant but now she has gone too far! [[Now]] that she has the dagger, we can not perform our rites without her approval. 
[[She]] has gone too far? 
You need her approval? 
What [[Mordea]] has done violates generations of tradition and work. 
[[Yes]]! Without her approval, we can not perform our rituals. We can not work under such conditions! We need to get the dagger back soon or there will be great danger. 
Get the dagger back. 
What kind of danger? 
I truly can not tell you. The [[Mountain]] [[King]]'s temper is, well, titanic. [[He]] may rip the land apart should we anger him. 
Rip the land apart? 
Anger him? 
[[Oh]] yes, earthquakes, fissures, landslides, the power of the [[Earth]] [[Titan]] is very great. I have never seen the power of [[His]] wrath before, but I have heard terrible stories. 
What stories? 
[[In]] the days before [[Moriens]] agreed to serve the [[Mountain]] [[King]], our lord did often rend the land as was [[His]] pleasure. 
Why did he do this? 
[[Please]], I do not have time to talk of this. I need to get the dagger back before Lothian dies. 
[[Yes]]. [[If]] I am not able to perform the appropriate ceremony upon Lothian, I will greatly disappoint, and anger, my [[Lord]]. 
[[How]]? Lothian is very ill and I must stay by her side. [[Besides]], neither of us are trained warriors to challenge [[Mordea]]'s guards. [[How]] could we possibly retrieve the dagger? 
I'll get the dagger. 
Stay by her side. 
Will you truly? 
[[Yes]]. 
No. 
Thank you! I have heard that [[Mordea]] keeps the dagger in her chambers. You will know the dagger by its golden hilt and serpentine blade. [[Please]] hurry, for soon we shall need the dagger! 
May I meet the [[Necromancer]]? 
[[That]] is a cruel jest. We need the dagger soon else we shall all suffer. 
[[It]] is as I have said, our ceremonies must occur at the correct time. I can tell you no more than that except to say that I must be present when Lothian dies. 
[[If]] you bring to me the dagger, I will get you an audience with the [[Necromancer]]. 
[[She]] is truly dead? [[Oh]] praise be to the [[Mountain]] [[King]]! [[Perhaps]] now we may get our dagger back and avert certain danger. 
What kind of dagger? 
You may get the dagger back. 
[[It]] is a very special dagger. This dagger was given to us by the [[Mountain]] [[King]] so that we may perform a very special ceremony. Without the dagger, I can not perform the ceremony. 
Unfortunately, I can not leave here. You see, I must stay by Lothian's side. 
Farewell, friend. 
[[Truly]]?! You have the dagger? Bless you, my friend, bless you! Your timing is perfect for I need the dagger immediately! May I please have the dagger? 
[[Not]] well, I fear. [[Our]] problem still exists and Lothian nears her end. [[Have]] you managed to get the dagger away from [[Mordea]]? 
What problem? 
[[Is]] Lothian dying? 
No, I don't have the dagger. 
[[Oh]]. I was hoping that you had retrieved the dagger for me. I am terribly afraid of what may happen if I do not get it soon. You did promise to get the dagger. [[Please]] do so as soon as possible. 
[[Have]] you completely forgotten the discussion which we had when first we met? [[By]] the power of the [[Mountain]] [[King]], man, how could you forget my plight when your own safety is at stake? [[Mordea]] has stolen our ceremonial dagger and you promised to retrieve it. 
[[Oh]] yes, I do remember. 
I was but joking, friend. 
I do remember from our first meeting that you have a sharp wit, but to say such a thing is more cruel than funny. [[By]] [[Lithos]]' eyes, please hold your jests until our crisis has past. 
[[How]] very nice of you to recall! [[Please]] listen closely, if you do not retrieve the dagger, I can not inter people. [[If]] I can not inter people, [[Lithos]] will become very upset. 
What will happen if [[Lithos]] becomes upset? 
I probably should not tell you this, since you are not a member of our order, but these are dire times. [[Lithos]] may rend the ground underneath our very feet. [[He]] may bring great landslides to destroy [[Tenebrae]]. [[He]] may create quakes that kill us all. [[Lithos]] is great and powerful and we do not want him to become upset. 
[[That]] sounds terrible. 
Could this really happen? 
Of course it sounds terrible! This is why I am so frantic! [[Now]] please, go and retrieve the dagger as you promised! 
I do not believe your questions! [[Is]] this another one of your jokes? Of course it could happen! [[Please]] leave me now. I am too un-nerved to speak. 
[[Yes]], she's dying! I told you that when last you were here. 
I am sorry friend, but I do not have time to tell you anything of the [[Mountain]] [[King]] that you can not already know. [[After]] you have retrieved the dagger for me, I will tell you in great length of our lord, the [[Earth]] [[Titan]]. 
[[Did]] you wish to continue this conversation, my friend? 
You are the [[Necromancer]]? 
You murdered that woman! 
Hello, [[Necromancer]]. 
I have brought you the reagents, [[Necromancer]]. 
I have met the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. 
I have interred Lothian, [[Necromancer]]. 
What must I do? 
I have seen the Birthplace of [[Moriens]]. 
I am now. With Lothian's passage, I step forward and take her place. [[As]] Lothian's [[Scion]], I was next in the [[Necromantic]] line of succession. 
What is a [[Scion]]? 
I killed her, yes. [[But]] I did not murder her. 
Well what's the difference? 
Why did you have to stab her? 
[[Have]] you not heard a word that I have said? The [[Ceremony]] of [[Eternity]] is one of our most sacred rites. [[It]] is [[Lithos]]' law! 
A [[Scion]] is the [[Necromancer]]'s chosen successor. [[It]] is normal for the [[Necromancer]]'s first apprentice to be the [[Scion]]. [[It]] is sad to say, but I was Lothian's only apprentice. [[Now]], I am in need of an apprentice. 
Why were you the only apprentice? 
You need an apprentice? 
Murdering some one is to take their life against their will. Lothian had known nearly her entire life that, when it was her time of passage, she would be killed in this fashion. The same will happen to me when it is my time. 
[[So]] that is the [[Ceremony]] of [[Eternity]]? 
The same will happen to you? 
[[It]] is as I have said: many people fear us, and many more can not live so demanding and structured life as is necessary of one who serves the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. 
Why do people fear you? 
[[Many]] people are ignorant and do not understand what we do. They think that we live with corpses and that we are diseased. All of this is foolishness. 
[[Yes]], the ceremony must be performed as [[Lithos]] has commanded. You see, as Lothian was [[Necromancer]], she will be permitted into the [[Hall]] of [[Eternity]]. [[In]] order to be allowed into this most hallowed of places, the [[Necromancers]] must be prepared in the [[Ceremony]] of [[Eternity]]. 
What is the [[Hall]] of [[Eternity]]? 
[[That]] is well. I hope that your experience was as wonderful as my own. 
The [[Hall]] of [[Eternity]] is a special place within the [[City]] of the [[Dead]]. The [[City]] of the [[Dead]] is a place where only [[Necromancers]] are allowed. [[It]] is there that [[Lithos]] sits upon [[His]] throne and consults [[His]] [[Necromancers]], and dispenses [[His]] judgement. The [[Hall]] is a most prestigious place. 
The [[City]] of the [[Dead]]? 
[[Yes]], the heart of [[Lithos]]' realm. The [[City]] of the [[Dead]] is where all [[Necromancers]] who have been interred go and live on in death under [[Lithos]]' gentle rule. 
[[Yes]], I do. While we are on this subject, it occurs to me that you are a man of exceptional qualities, both physical and spiritual. Would you wish to become my apprentice? 
[[Yes]], I am honored. 
No, thank you. 
[[Good]], then it is so done. [[As]] my apprentice, I would have you begin your studies immediately. [[Much]] must be learned before one can wield the magic of a [[Necromancer]]. 
I'll learn magic? 
[[First]] you must gather some reagents for me. Return them to me and I will teach you of their magical properties. There will be other tasks to follow. [[If]] you accomplish all of them correctly, then I shall make you my apprentice, and most likely, the [[Scion]]. [[After]] that, you shall make a pilgrimage. 
What reagents do you need? 
A pilgrimage? 
[[Do]] not concern yourself with that now. There is much that must be done before you may even think about your holy pilgrimage. 
This saddens me. I do think that you would make a fine apprentice, and eventually, [[Necromancer]]. [[Is]] your mind completely made up, are you certain that you do not wish to be my apprentice? 
[[Yes]], I am certain. 
Well, perhaps I should be your apprentice. 
Very well, I am sure you have good reason for your decision. I am, however, very busy and must get on with my duties. Thank you very much for your help, but I must be on my way. 
[[Good]], then it is done. [[As]] my apprentice, I would have you begin your studies immediately. [[Much]] must be learned before one can wield the magic of the [[Necromancer]]. 
[[Indeed]] you will, my apprentice. [[By]] the time that you have completed your studies, you will be capable of more than you ever dreamed possible. 
There is much to learn. 
[[Indeed]] there is, apprentice. [[That]] is why you must consult the library freely and often. There you will learn much of our order, our history, and our magic. 
Where is the library? 
Will you help me learn? 
[[It]] is located just upstairs. [[Feel]] free to use it at any time. I expect to see you there quite often. 
[[Yes]], of course, my student. [[It]] is part of my responsibility to teach you all that I know. 
I need for you to bring me a sample of [[Executioner]]'s [[Hood]] from a place of danger and fallen sticks from a place where spirits roam. 
These items are -magical-? 
What does [[Executioner]]'s [[Hood]] look like? 
Where spirits roam? 
[[Yes]], that is very important. Go to Western [[Tenebrae]]. There you will find the sticks, better known as `deadman's elbows,' that I need. 
Each taken individually, the item's magical properties are inert. [[However]], when blended together under the proper conditions and intonements, their magical qualities are unlocked. All of this you will learn in time. 
[[It]] is a black, leafy plant. [[It]] grows nearby, between the Graveyard and [[Tenebrae]]. Look for the hood under a large tree. [[It]] is a rare plant, so look closely. 
Of course. When my time comes to be sent to meet the [[Mountain]] [[King]], my first apprentice will perform the [[Ceremony]] of [[Eternity]] and prepare me for my journey. [[It]] is the way of the [[Necromancer]]. 
Give them to me. 
You have done well, my apprentice. For your efforts and your obvious learning, I have something for you. This is the Key of the Caretaker. [[It]] will allow you entry into the Upper [[Catacombs]]. There you must go to learn more of our art. 
What is in the [[Catacombs]]? 
Where are the upper catacombs? 
What is the Key of the Caretaker? 
The Key is an item of power which will allow you to cast the spells which you will learn in the [[Catacombs]]. [[In]] order to cast spells, you must place the proper reagents in a bag, close the bag, and then invoke the power of the key on the closed bag. When you open the bag, you will find a magic talisman within. When you invoke the magic of the talisman, you cast the spell. 
There you will find the ancient [[Necromancers]]. Those who travelled the path of the [[Necromancer]] long before you or I. [[My]]  ancient ancestors will teach you what you need to know of our magic. 
[[How]] am I to find them? 
Can you not teach me magic? 
With good faith and a strong heart. [[Do]] not worry, apprentice. The [[Ancient]] [[Necromancers]] will make themselves known to you. 
I can, and in years to come I will. [[However]], the first level of spells you must learn from the ancient [[Necromancers]]. Those who first created the spells that you will learn will teach them to you. [[If]] you pass their tests, you will learn their magic. Then you must come back to me. 
You will find the entrance to the catacombs through the very rock itself. You will need the [[Open]] [[Earth]] spell, which you can find in the library, and the Key of the Caretaker. Go you then just north of here. There you will find a small hall. [[Cast]] the [[Open]] [[Earth]] spell upon the rock face and you shall gain entrance to the the catacombs. 
The spell is in the library? 
[[Yes]], there you find much that will help you. For in order that you may speak to the [[Necromancers]], there is another spell which you must learn. 
What is there that will help me? 
What other spell? 
[[As]] the [[Necromancers]] are, to be certain, dead, you must cast [[Death]] [[Speak]] upon their sacred corpses. [[Only]] then shall you hear the voices of wisdom from their lifeless mouths. This spell you shall also find in the library. 
[[In]] the library, there are books of knowledge. [[Not]] only spells that you must learn, but also the history of our [[Necromantic]] order. [[In]] the library you will also find many reagents which you may use when learning to cast spells. 
[[And]] since you are still alive, I can see that [[He]] and [[His]] [[Ancient]] [[Necromancers]] did approve of you. [[Now]], I have something else for you, my apprentice. 
The journey was difficult. 
You have something for me? 
[[Yes]], I remember when I met the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. I too found the journey most difficult. Yet, all has been worth the effort. 
[[Not]] yet, my apprentice. [[Did]] [[Lithos]] tell you that there is one last task for you to perform? 
[[Yes]], he did. 
No, he didn't. 
[[He]] did not? I do not believe you. The [[Mountain]] [[King]] instructed me to ask you if [[He]] had told you what you must do. [[He]] told me [[He]] instructed you to inter Lothian. [[If]] you did not perform this task, you were to be expelled from [[His]] order. [[Now]] you lie to me. Therefore, you must go from here. [[Never]] return here again. 
What did [[He]] tell you? 
I must inter Lothian. 
[[That]] is correct, apprentice. [[Take]] this, the Key of the [[Scion]]. [[By]] touching this item to Lothian, you will make her body acceptable for interment, as commanded in our covenant with [[Lithos]]. Know that this Key will also permit access through many doors within the [[Catacombs]]. 
Thank you, [[Necromancer]]. 
You did not give me a key, [[Necromancer]]. 
[[Another]] key? 
Where is Lothian? 
You will find her outside of the tomb, near the Northeast corner of the building. There her body awaits you to send it to the [[Mountain]] [[King]]. 
[[Yes]], but as you have seen, these keys are not what one normally thinks of as a key. This is not so much a physical key as it is a spiritual one. 
Farewell, apprentice. 
Farewell, my friend. 
You have done well, my apprentice. You have shown yourself well. You have served with bravery and great knowledge. I have decided to name you [[Scion]] and thereby officially name you my heir in the Necromatic line. [[Now]], you are ready to make your pilgrimage. 
[[Oh]] yes, my pilgrimage. 
Greetings to you, my apprentice. I trust that all is well? 
[[Yes]], I am well. 
No, things are not well. 
[[Good]], good. [[Lithos]] does provide well for [[His]] followers. 
Well, trust in [[Lithos]] and everything will work out. 
[[Yes]], your pilgrimage. [[It]] is customary for the [[Scion]] to make a pilgrimage to the birthplace of [[Moriens]]. There, the [[Scion]] does pay homage to [[Moriens]] and hope for a visitation. 
Where is this place? 
A visitation? 
[[Yes]], well do I remember my pilgrimage. [[Long]] did I travel, and such an adventure it was. [[And]] when I arrived at the holy birthplace, I did see a most magnificent thing. [[It]] was so wonderous that first I thought myself to be mad. 
Was it dangerous? 
What did you see? 
[[Perhaps]] it is best that I do not tell you. I would not wish to color your expectations. [[After]] all, everyone comes away from their pilgrimage with a different experience. [[But]] be certain that your experience shall be a profound one. 
What kind of a question is that from a man who has already performed such great deeds? 
You must return to the Upper [[Catacombs]]. [[Once]] there, seek out the signs that mark the way. 
Say no more, [[Scion]]. You have earned your status. 
[[Did]] you wish to continue this conversation?
