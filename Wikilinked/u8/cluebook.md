HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

GENERAL HINTS

Introduction and Plot-Path Hints. These hints are for those who only want
a very gentle nudge. They are a fictionalized summary of what people (names
in bold) have information to keep you on the plotline, and also gives clues to
some subplots, [[Pagan]] history and character situations.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Times of Day. Some people are found at different places depending on the time.
Food and Recuperation. This tells how food affects regeneration of hit points.
Statistics. Your statistics are dynamic, and they influence how well you interact
with your environment. This section tells how they change, and how they affect
your performance.

Location. Press (Ctrl [V). The last number is the map number. This informa-
tion will help you discover where you are after teleportation, or when you're
just plain lost.

ARMOR & WEAPONS

Note. Each magical item is listed with a unique number (e.g., M9) that
appears in the map keys.

This section provides an arsenal of information about the weapons and armor
at your disposal:

+ Their weight.

+ Their damage or defense values.

+ Any special attributes they have.
+ Where to find the rarer items.

DENIZENS & DANGERS

Here you'll find all the statistics on each and every monster, creature, person
and danger that you'll face:

+ Their statistics — Armor Class, Dexterity, Damage, and Hit Points.
+ Any special abilities they have.
+ Any vulnerabilities you can use to your advantage.

MaAps

The two letters in the parenthesis refer to the specific map. (See General
Information, Location.) The number specifies where the object or event is on
that map.

The maps serve a triple function:

+ They give you an idea of where you are and where you need to go.

They are keyed to help you find objects and places that are necessary or useful.

They are cross-referenced to the Walkthrough, to help you through difficult areas
without having to read through the whole section.

MaGICc

This contains information on spells.

“t+

ate

+ How to cast a spell.

+ Whar you need to cast a spell, and some good areas to find them.

+ What each spell does.

+ How much mana it costs and what its damage is, plus how much it weighs
(if applicable).

+ What each reagent, focus and item looks like.

WALKTHROUGH
Note. Two sub-plots — [[Ghost]] and Slayer — are included.

This has three methods for use.

Cross-referencing from the maps gives you quick-fix information.

General step-by-step instruction lets you scan down the left of the page to
see what you need to do without sifting through extra information.

Detailed instructions tell you everything you must do to get through an area,
a section, a level or the entire game.

TIPS

General pointers to help you fully enjoy the game. Information is broken into
General Advice, Money and Items, Dangers and Magic categories.

 

INTRODUCTION

ow you have summoned me from my slumber I cannot guess. The

method must have been unusual in its power, and unique in the cast-

ing. I am awakened, and for that I am grateful. It is not my true

nature to remain oblivious to the flow of time; the currents of eternity are as
lifeblood coursing through my being. My purpose is awareness — it is my existence.
Since the coming of the [[Titans]] my eyes have been shrouded and dim. I once
marked and exulted in every event which occurred on this isle, from the sharp
spark of a blade of grass plucked by grazing toraxen to the harmonic thrum of the
ever-growing caverns. I saw all until the currents of time banished my lord [[Apathas]]
from his true position. I am his son, Remvatos, whom the people call The Observer.
From your silence I can tell that I am not the one you expected to answer your
summons. You expected power, perhaps? Did you call on [[Amoras]], hoping for the
divine gift of love and happiness? Or are your ambitions more martial — your
desire for the war-skills and cunning strategies of [[Odion]]? I am neither of those, and
have no real power to bestow upon you, but do not return me to the darkness so
soon. For if you have any curiosity about the world of [[Pagan]], I am your best oracle.
I have seen all, and for the privilege of brief stays in the realm of light, I shall tell

you all I know. ® ® =) ®@ ® @

MAPS

ometimes, when the pearly covering of [[Pagan]] grows thin and

looks like sheets of kith silk billowing in a storm, you can dimly

glimpse a pale disk. It is called the Eye of [[Stratos]]. Cold and still
in a turbulent heaven, it peers from above as if trying to see into the dim
and shadowed world of [[Pagan]]. There is no one left, not even [[Stratos]], who
could put the name “sun” to the Eye of [[Stratos]] — but long before the new
gods came and vanquished [[Apathas]], my father, the sun shone brightly on an
island of verdant life. In the space of a day, too long ago for mortal memory,
the clouds came and the rays of the sun were warded away.

The first to die were the flowering plants, then the animals which fed on
them. Grasses and soaring trees disappeared, replaced by moss, fungus and
hardy shrubs. In time the mushrooms and shrubs grew in size, but they do
not provide the shelter and food for wildlife that the light-drenched world
supported. The people, in their own way, adapted to their new world, but
the teeming farms and bustling cities of yesterday are quiet and still. These
generations do not find it unusual, nor do they notice that their numbers are
decreasing. I find it almost unsettling to think that unless things change, I
may not have a world to observe in a few millennia, just a bare dome of

rock in a cold, lifeless sea. And then I, too, shall perish. ®©@ ® ® ®

GENERAL INFORMATION

TIMES OF Day

There are six time periods each approximately four hours long in [[Pagan]]:

+ [[Bloodwatch]]  (Mid-dark)

+ [[Firstebb]] (Before daybreak)
+ Daytide (From daybreak)
+ [[Threemoons]] (Mid-light)

+ [[Lastebb]] (After mid-light)

+ Eventide (From light’ end)

FOOD AND POTIONS

People who eat regularly, neither too often nor too rarely, recuperate more
quickly than those who do not. Every fourth or fifth meal, if not taken imme-
diately after the previous meal, provides a small burst of increased health.

Potions are common on [[Pagan]], and their effects are related to their colors.

+ Red fully completely restores your health, unless you are 100% healthy (have 100%
hit points). In that case, it reduces your hit points by up to half.

+ Yellow increases your hit points by 10-12 points.

+ Orange increases your mana by 10-12 points.

+ Purple gives you temporary invulnerability. The effect lasts approximately 60-90
seconds.

+ Green is poison, and lowers your hit points by 10-12 points.

+ Black makes you invisible. The effect lasts approximately 60-90 seconds.

+ Blue puts you to sleep temporarily. It does not restore either mana or health, and
does not work on anyone else.

STATISTICS

Hit points are a measure of your health. Each attack that “succeeds” against
you reduces your hit points. When they reach zero, you die.

Damage is the amount of hit points subtracted from a target after a successful
attack.

Armor Class is how much damage is subtracted/deflected from a successful

hit. The percentage subtracted is your armor class multiplied by three (e.g.,
AC = 20, 60% of the damage is subtracted from a hit).

> 26 <

 

Dexterity is how agile a person is, and relates to how often an attack will be
successful. The range is from 1 (low) to 25 (high).

Mana is a unit of magic power.

Strength relates to how much weight you can carry, how effective your attacks
are (in combination with dexterity). Swinging a weapon is a good way to
increase strength. A new warrior has a strength of 15, while a seasoned veteran
may attain 25.

Intelligence is effects your ability to create and cast spells. The more intelligent
you are, the more often you get a high number of charges when creating sorcer-
ous spells — reading a great number of books increases your intelligence.
Weight refers to how much is in your inventory, including the armor, weapons

and clothes on your body.

+ Maximum Strength 25

+ Maximum Intelligence 25

+ Maximum Dexterity 25

+ Maximum Mana 50 (2 x Intelligence)

+ Maximum Hit Points 50 (2 x Strength)

+ Maximum Weight 75 (3 x Strength) [version 2.10]

100 (4 x Strength) [version 2.11]

~ have noticed that wherever adventurers of any kind gather, by the
~4 warm red firelight in [[Orlok]]’s tavern or on the chill stone of the

practice arena, gradually the talk turns from daily concerns to the
legendary feats of bygone eras. Warriors’ exploits are related, discussed and
studied both by those who hunger for the fever-pitch of battles and those
who are simply driven by insatiable curiosity. In due time, the talk drifts to
the greatest of ancient heroes, Bluesword.

It is generally thought that his true name and family was a mystery even
in his own time. That much is true. He was certainly a warrior like no
other. His sharp mind could devise tactics against which there were no
defense, and his untiring speed and agility made him seem almost inhuman.
His greatest strength, however, was that he persuaded or coerced all the
greatest magic-crafiers on the Great Isle to charm his armor and enspell his
weapons. These charmed tools, combined with his preternatural skills, gave
him the ability to stand alone against an army, preventing their advance
from the first glow of dawn to the last shimmer of twilight, when only the
eerie blue glow of his sword edge could be seen weaving and dancing in the
first dark. When Bluesword died, his magic armory vanished. Some say the
magic evaporated with his last breath, while others believe that he carried
the tools of his trade with him to the far side of The Dark. There are still
others who insist that the magic items were simply scattered and hidden.

There is no certainty in mortal minds — only fuel for endless hours of talk.

tell you now that [[Pagan]] is a dangerous place. The servants of

[[Lithos]], the ghouls, are driven to destroy all living humans. This you
know. But what is secret is that after the victim has lain dead for a while —
long enough to cool, but yet be fresh — the slayer’ comrades emerge from the
crevices of the ground and devour the corpse, from shredded flesh to the last
bone shard. I warn you also that newborn kith are without skeletons or
armor. They work their small, soft bodies into the tiny cracks of dungeons and
catacombs, so that not even rooms that appear to be securely sealed are ever
truly safe from their kind.

As for traps and other dangers that are hidden, [[Pagan]] is full of them.
They were built by people who wished to guard their secrets, by necro-
mancers protecting their labyrinthine tombs, and sometimes even by the
original architects who served gods that predated even my father and the
other [[Zealan]] gods. Of these events I have no knowledge, but can only respect

the endurance of these mortal creations. ® @ @ =)

UNDEAD AND SUPERNATURAL CREATURES

AERIAL SERVANT

Capabilities. Aerial servants do the bidding of their Theurgist masters, using

_ their powers to manipulate physical objects to perform their tasks. Although obe-
dient, they are more aware of their fate than most undead and sometimes may
struggle to rebel and obstruct. They are much like ghosts in all other respects.

GHOST

Capabilities. These beings are trapped in the vicinity of their deaths, but not
restrained by any physical obstacles. It is quite clear that they are immune to
direct physical attacks, but spells and magical weapons do damage them. They are
violently jealous of those still living, and use their invisibility as a natural defense.

one has ever been able to harm a Minion, but they will snatch the bodies of
people foolish enough to enter the water, and drag them beneath the surface.

Cc t is generally understood that [[Stellos]] is the wisest of the [[Theurgists]]. His
~§ age counts decades as mortal men count years, and he treats knowledge

and learning as a bottomless well to an unquenchable thirst. His powers
are unmatched. It is said that [[Stellos]] is the wisest of them all, yet [[Stellos]] himself
has never been known to claim true wisdom. It is not humility that keeps him
quiet, though. It is only that [[Stellos]], alone of mortals, remembers Boreas.

Boreas was more than a healer of wounds and ills. When she discovered
hunger, she fought it as though it were a plague. Foresters were called to teach the
craft of trapping toraxen, fishers to teach the art of casting nets, and artisans were
urged to take apprentices. Where she found crime, there was no surcease of vigi-
lance until justice prevailed. Neighbors were united with her leadership, and
they pacified the undead until even the farthest reaches were safe for travellers.
[[Pagan]] seemed to gleam during her lifetime, cleaner for her touch. She was loved
by most, respected by all, and particularly beloved to [[Stellos]]. When she drew near
death, she forbade her friend to extend her life. She was old, she said, and her
lifetime was complete. [[Stellos]] left her side, unable to watch her leave his world.
He has never mentioned her since that day — neither from bitterness nor a
hardened heart, but from a buried grief that still burns raw for Boreas, wis-

est of the [[Theurgists]]. @® ® ®@ ® ® 3) @ @

MAGIC
NECROMANCY

Necromancers are the servants of [[Lithos]], and are skilled at manipulating the
residual energy left behind when life departs from its physical shell. This ener-
gy is emitted as etheric waves. In preparation for controlling this magic, the
necromancer keeps reagents near to hand. These are simply natural materials
that are consumed entirely by the magic process. Each spell is only good for

one casting per preparation.

To create a Necromantic spell

Put the appropriate reagents in a pouch.

++ +t

Close the pouch.
Use the Key of the Caretaker on the pouch.

+f.

The spell is then “readied,” and may be used at any time.
Note. Casting, not creating, the spell is when mana is consumed.

REAGENTS

[Version 2.10] Each individual reagent weighs I apiece. When they are stacked,
some weigh 1/10th apiece, rounding up to the nearest whole number (e.g. 1-10
weighs 1, 11-20 weighs 2.).

THEURGY

Purity is the goal for [[Theurgists]]. Although they begin their studies using small
tokens to serve as foci for their thoughts, as these monks gain skill they no
longer need the artificial help of any physical items. This level of enlighten-
ment, however, takes years to attain — during which their silver foci are
invaluable. Once the token is charged, the spell can be cast innumerable times,
limited only by the amount of the caster’s mana.

To create a Theurgistic spell

+ Get the silver ore from the caves beneath [[Argentrock Isle]].

+ Take the ore to [[Korick]] the Smith and have him forge the tokens.

+ Place the tokens, one at a time, on the Altar of Focus on [[Argentrock Isle]].

The tokens are now charged foci and may be used at any time, as often as desired.
Note. Mana is used when you cast the spell.

SORCERY

Sorcery is the study of otherworldly powers and beings that may be called
upon for destructive purposes. [[Sorcerers]] function in Cabals — one Master
with four Acolytes. They walk a razor’s edge: the Acolytes’ power adds to that
of the Master, but when an [[Acolyte]] becomes powerful enough, the master
faces challenge or assassination. Most Masters take care of those who become a
threat before true danger actually manifests. Many is the [[Acolyte]] who has
become an offering to the powers involved in Sorcery ....

Touch the token to determine the number of charges it holds. Although the
number of charges it takes is largely chance, the caster’s intelligence also affects

+ Place spell’s focus at the center of the A

[[pentagram]]. The foci (wand, rod,

etc.) have to be as near the center of Red Candle

 

the [[pentagram]] as possible.
+ Place candles (black or red, as indi-
cated) at each point around the
circle. Candles must be placed on the holders (centered) and be lit. Each spell has
different places for black and red candles.
Place the indicated reagents inside the point of the star, near the candles. The reagents
must be as close to their respective candles as possible; in some cases you can place them
on top of the candles.
Stand outside the [[pentagram]] and double-click on it. The reagents disappear after the
focus is enchanted, but the candles remain and can be reused.

Flame — the refuse of the volcano has the property of creating

Distance — this rock, cast highest and farthest from the vol-

Duration — while seeming to be a fragile, easily broken sub-
stance, it endures the heat of the volcano.

Protection — iron’s hard yet versatile nature works in protec-
tive Sorcery as no other reagent can.

Power — this is the rock that burns or, more to the point in
Sorcery, explodes. A virtually limitless source of power dwells
within its etheric composition.

Summoning/Binding — having taken a hint from the
Necromancers, the Cabal found that Bone does, indeed, retain
its tie to life. It is even useful in the ritual of binding when
enough power is at hand. Daemonic forces are summoned and

ture of the [[Sorcerer]]’s choice. The
dangerous nature of this spell lies in
the fact that if no victim is specified as
soon as the creature appears, the dae-
mon will attack the [[Sorcerer]]. After
accomplishing its task, the daemon will
be “loose” unless banished.

 

Mana 18-23
[[Reagents]] Ash, [[Daemon]] Bone, Obsidian, Pumice

Banish [[Daemon]] (An Flam Corp Xen)

Effect As the name so plainly states, this spell
will usually return a daemon to its wf
home in the fire of the volcano.
Unfortunately, even the most skilled
[[Sorcerers]] have been known to attempt
an unsuccessful banishment, which
only draws the daemon’s attention to
the [[Sorcerer]].

 

Mana 18-23

Conflagration (Kal Vas Flam Corp Xen)

Effect This is the most powerful ritual that
the [[Sorcerer]]'s Cabal has revealed. If any
greater exists, only they know about it.
By use of this spell, a malicious force of
fire manifests near the caster, where it
then commences to wreak savage
destruction on all things nearby.

Duration Approximately 20 seconds

[[Reagents]] Ash, Brimstone, [[Daemon]] Bone, Iron,
Pumice, Obsidian

THAUMATURGY

Thaumaturgy is a relatively rare form of magic on [[Pagan]]. It results from the
study of all magic and therefore touches on all of the powers the others pos-
sess, to greater or lesser degrees. Due to the extremely rare and costly nature of
certain of the reagents, some of which do not seem to exist any longer on
[[Pagan]], if they ever did, it is a discipline that creates more curiosity than it pro-
vides answers. Only [[Mythran]] sells either the spellbooks or the reagents, and
there is no other source for the books.

To create a Thaumaturgic spell
+ Put the spellbook in a pouch.
+ Put the reagents in the pouch.

+ Use the book.
The spell is then ready and can be cast by using the book.

REAGENTS
Each reagent weighs 1, regardless of quantity.
A book can only be charged with one type of spell.

Eye of Newt
Intrinsic Forces Sight/Knowledge — this aids a mage in focusing the inner
eye within the mind.
| Main Location [[Mythran]]
te Cost 25 obsidian coins

Intrinsic Forces Life/Creatures — the flesh, bone and blood found in this
structure serve as an excellent lodestone to the essence of life.

“7, Main Location _Mythran

Cost 25 obsidian coins
Serpent Scale
Intrinsic Forces Destruction/Separation — the poison in the mouth of this

beast seeps into the flesh and corrupts the scales, giving them
the magical ability to act as a destructor of bonds.

Main Location [[Mythran]]

Cost 25 obsidian coins

> 59 <

Dragon Blood
Intrinsic Forces Great Power — so powerful is this creature that the blood
burns as if aflame. Precise measurements of this are wise, for
& too much and the magic goes dangerously awry.

Main Location [[Mythran]]
Cost 40 obsidian coins

SPELLS
Mana is expended when a book is charged with a spell, not when the spell is
actively cast.

Confusion Blast (In Quas Wis)

Effect This causes a release of etheric energies, inflicting no real physical damage, but
causing all combatants near the Thaumaturge to completely forget the present
combat.

Spellbook 50 obsidian coins

Mana 3

Duration Until an outside force renews combat.

[[Reagents]] Eye of Newt, Bat Wing, Serpent Scale, Obsidian, Brimstone

kith, daemon, etc.) to the Thaumaturge’s defense.
Spellbook 100 obsidian coins

Mana 3
[[Reagents]] Serpent Scale, Dragon Blood, Ash, Pig Iron, Executioner’s Hood

Devastation (In Vas Ort Corp)

Effect This spell, first formulated by what could only have been an insane mage, is
designed to disrupt the very fabric of life throughout the world. All creatures
and beings face instant eradication. As far as can be told, there has never been
a successful casting of this spell.

TEMPESTRY

‘[[Tempestry]] is an inherited covenant with [[Hydros]], [[Titan]] of Water. It is impossible
to “acquire” these powers; one is born with them. It gives the [[Tempest]] the power
to control the water and storms, clouds and lightning. Only true Tempests can
wield this magic, and they need no material components.

PLOT-PATH HINTS

TENEBRAE

waken at your wish. I see you are a troubled and uncertain traveller
~4 in my home-realm. The eyes of Remvatos are all-seeing, and it is clear

that this world is confusing to anyone new to its shores. The verdant,
troubled island of [[Pagan]] is inhabited by a wide range of people, from nar-
row-minded to-quietly heroic. Though I have spent much time in the
darkness, the natures of this new generation are instantly revealed to me, as
true as if they were written in gilt-bound volumes. Some are petty, some
seem grander than they have right to claim, while others strive to overcome
the myriad obstacles fate has arranged for them. DEVON can be a valuable
ally, recently grieved by the many executions near what was once his peace-
ful beach haven. His friend BENTIC, the scholar, has read enough books to
fill a dozen libraries, and has consequently grown very wise. Indeed, while
all the opinions of citizens of [[Tenebrae]] are worth hearing, Bentics advice is
best followed, even when the way is dangerous and difficult. There are tales,
too, which a traveller seeking after adventure might heed. [[Orlok]] may have
time to tell you a tale or two, and some townspeople may know more than
he does, if prompted.

Lf adventure is what you seek, however, there is more than enough to be
had outside the walls of [[Tenebrae]]. Vivibos the [[Necromancer]] is in need of
aid, and would appreciate a bold ally as well as an apprentice. The village-
folk are wary of the Necromantic ways, but [[Vividos]] is an honest man.
ARAMINA knows things that could help him, but she is too timid of nature
to be of much use on her own. MORDEA is dangerous and hinders or
destroys anyone whose power might threaten her — and hides her secrets in
the Great Palace, behind locked doors and under darkness. LOTHIAN clings
to life in a world on the brink of change, and although she struggles to live
until the proper rituals are possible, her grip is weakening. A storm of a new

age gathers ...

CHANGE IN RULE

ou have summoned me, and I answer. During my slumber, the good

fisher has been imprisoned by his foes, and his truest friend has been

taken from him. I can feel that the forces of darkness are so preva-
lent that the loss of one bright aura of good is keenly felt, like a cold mist
over the land. The loss of DEVON would be as chilling as a winter deluge —
his need of help is pressing. SALKIND is an important part of [[Mordea]]’s
power, and keeps her oldest secret sealed behind a wall in the deepest part of
the Great Palace. Yet even the strongest walls can be breached, as MYTHRAN
knows well. Moreover, he knows the value of the shield he keeps, though he
may withhold this fact. Secrets only grow in power the longer they are kept.
[[Mordea]]’s secrets should not be confined to the darkness, but should be
announced to the people as bold truth. The storm will begin ....

@® ® ®

LITHOS

short while only, and my eyes light again upon the world. It is pleas-
oF to see your path has opened before you — though it may be dark

and arduous. VIVIDOS always proves most helpful to those who assist
him, and his apprentice will have access to items, spells and information
invaluable to the adventurer. He can point you to the home of L1rHos —
and to become apprentice to [[Lithos]] is to gain undeniably useful knowledge,
powers and items. LOTHIAN’S remains must be sent to the titan of [[Earth]]
before her soul can truly rest, and in these times the peace of the dead is a
hallowed privilege. Hallowed and rare.

ZEALANS

his time you did not summon me, but I use the trace of our link to
ue your mind, and I hope your spirit heeds me. My father,

APATHAS, deep within the lair of the oppressor [[Titan]] of [[Earth]], has felt
a presence through the living surface and rocky ground. I believe it must be
you. Descend beyond all previous levels to where the true rulers of [[Pagan]]
stand captive and-immobile. Heed my father’s words, and those of his mighty
equals. If all goes well, they will reveal a destiny undreamed by mortals.

STRATOS

raveller! I see that the storms of change are but as wind at your back!
o Indeed, ARGENTROCK ISLE has many who would appreciate your

courage and talents. XAVIER tests countless promising students, and
STELLOS has guided many with his wisdom, but you have the ability to suc-
ceed beyond any previous accomplishments. KORICK, the smith, has also
been known to be useful to the students of [[Stellos]] — in a practical way. I
have seen your acts of strength, but I also know your heart, and your com-
passion marks you for great things, for leadership. STELLOS may be wise
enough to mark it in your actions. The others are too gnawed by the prob-
lems of their small lives to make momentous changes — though sometimes
they know more than they tell. CYRRUS is one such. Some aspire to reach
STRATOS, but where they fall short, you may not. The world is vast, with a
myriad of paths to truth, and when one is completed, the next beckons ....

deepest abyss. You have mounted the skies. Look you now to flowing worlds of
CARTHAX if you wish another quest. HYDROS would doubtless reward any
adventurer who endeavored to free her, and your redoubtable magic can make a
long-dead spring the fountainhead for a [[Titan]]’ floodwaters. The new [[Tempest]]’
power is involved, however, and one never gains power without another’ loss. As
no one relishes lost power, once [[Hydros]] is loosed, DEVON will doubtless have a
request. If your warrior’ heart yearns for the fiery thrills of danger ....

PYROS

he world is in turbulent upheaval, I can feel its resonance in every
Sv and stream. The air seems to breathe it. A balance has been

toppled and must be righted. The [[Sorcerers]] of DAEMON’S CRAG are
key. Speak to the acolytes, and be agreeable to all, though I fear they confide
their closest secrets only to their own. Greatness awaits you there, although
the way is fierce. The [[Master Sorcerer]] MALCHIR can be a great ally or a
powerful foe, and is not incapable of being both. Seek guidance from others
such as BEREN or GORGROND — they are familiar with forces that I am
sure will further your quest. Your passage causes powerful forces to awaken,
and I sense that you will not be stopped by any obstacle, no matter how

securely your way is barred.

our victory is nearly complete, [[Avatar]]. For the first time I can clear-

fire and rains, as well as the trembling of the ground. STRATOS’ tricks can-
not blind you, and DEVON knows your abilities — he will help. There are
dangers now, but I know the gateway will open before you, lifting you
beyond all worldly obstacles.

TIPS

GENERAL ADVICE

SNSO = Save Now, Save Often

Never drop your bedroll, the Key of the Scion, the Key of the Caretaker, the Recall
Item or any [[Blackrock]] items.

Always activate nearby Recall Pads by walking near or on them.

Kill ghouls to raise strength and dexterity status. Later take on kith, as well.

You can move dead ghouls.

When waiting for someone to arrive somewhere, /eave the area and sleep. A person
wont come if you sleep nearby.

When getting wooden sticks for [[Vividos]], ghosts won't attack you if you aren’t in
Combat Mode.

The maximum armor class is 29.

MONEY AND ITEMS

+

Skeletons will have different things in their inventory each time you kill them.

Use restorative potions as you find them, they weigh quite a bit and sleep is more useful.
Use bags to organize your things.

You can pile some objects (such as coins and necromantic reagents) on top of one
another — they'll take up less room and weigh less.

Stacked reagents take up less room than the spells you could make with them.

Use a keyring (CT, 2), then you don’t have to carry the extra weight of lots of keys or
remember which is which.

Don‘ steal valuable things (coins, armor, weapons, etc.) when people are around.
Inside a broken-down wooden house in West [[Tenebrae]], you can move the wood and
debris, and jump into a lower room. You can find 67 coins there. Get out again by
standing on the pile of wood and climbing out.

The only place you need money is at [[Mythran]]’s. You can leave your money at his
house so that you don't have to carry the extra weight. (Each coin weighs 1/100 a
[[Pagan]] “stone.”)

Changelings and ghosts drop money and items when they die.

You can steal from [[Korick]] if he steps off the screen for a second.

> 68 <

 

DANGEROUS OR INTERESTING PLACES

%

ote
+

There is a “cheat room” in the Lower Catacombs that contains most magical
weapons, armor and other useful things. Stand in front of the recess (LC, 4), facing
north. Then jump forward and upwards. The teleporter is invisible and high enough
that you can walk under it without triggering it.

When entering [[Mythran]]’s house, if you run through the entryway without hesita-
tion, you'll be safe.

When crossing Rolling Spheres, you can leap them if you jump slightly to the side, ~
but not directly over them.

In places where there are red mushrooms, don't walk behind things — there may be
mushrooms that you cantt see.

Beware of glowing spots in Upper Catacombs floors. They are fire spouts.

Beware of small dark rings on cavern and catacomb floors. They are spikes.

Beware of walking near puddles in the catacombs. The floor is weak.

If you hear lava sounds where you don’t see lava, walk near the wall.

In the [[Hall of the Mountain King]], you can walk along the edge of the water, and
skip the jumping part. .

ai

Don't have daemon bone near a [[pentagram]] when casting — it might summon one.
You can use Endure Heat to cross red lava. Yellow lava is too liquid to cross.

Cast Extinguish on self to put out all flames.

The [[First Acolyte]] of [[Daemon]]'s Crag always lives in the [[First Acolyte]]’s building
(DC, 4), no matter who currently has the position.

Scattered around [[Pagan]], especially in [[Tenebrae]], there are a number of magic scrolls.
There are five different kinds: Secret Door Scroll, Trap Detection Scroll, Trap
Destruction Scroll, Scroll of Healing, and the Scroll of Invisibility.

ou would do well to learn the philosophies of the [[Theurgists]],

Traveller. For every ill there is a cure, for every path barred, there

is a way around or over or through. There are no questions with-
out answers.

The Pagans have a story. Once there was a child who awoke from a
dreamless sleep, only to find himself in a strange place — a house he had
never seen before. In this house there were many wonders, and he knew it
was filled with magic. There were no doors or chimneys, and the narrow
windows looked out into a black, depthless void. The youngster first sought
help by crying out for his parents or any nearby aid, but his words were
trapped within the walls. When that proved useless, he searched for switches
or levers or keys that might open a secret passageway. The walls proved bare,
however, and the drawers and boxes were empty. Then, he reasoned, there
must be a magical exit hidden nearby. He looked for books which might
give him the words he needed, but there were none to be found. He then sat
upon the floor and thought.

Eventually he decided the only way out would be through the very floor
itself. He used a nearby dagger to pry up some boards, and made a chilling
discovery. Beneath the floor there was not dirt, but the same unwavering
darkness that hung outside the windows. Then the answer was clear. He
knew there was only one way to escape. He lay down on the bed, and closed
his eyes. When he awoke, he was safely home. So you see, friend, you will
never find your way truly blocked. There is always pasag. ®@ @® ®

[[Kilandra]] (FR, 1) has opinions about [[Mordea]]’s despotic rule.
[[Orlok]] (WT, 1) mentions the past reign of the Necromancers.

The Recall Pad is on top of Great Palace; activate it by walking

near or on it.

Note. Recall Pads are square gray platforms that raise and animate an X
on top of them as well as have animating pixels under them.

Extra. In the southeastern tower of the castle is a keyring (CT, 2) in a bas-
ket in a barrel. (The keyring helps because, no matter how many keys are
on the ring, its weight is always one. Also it keeps your keys organized and
you don't have to remember which key is which.)

He is at the library, either upstairs or at a desk downstairs.
Ask about [[Tenebrae]].

Ask if he knows how to leave [[Pagan]].

Tell him you wish to leave [[Pagan]].

Ask about [[Mythran]].

Ask where [[Mythran]] lives.

Extra. In this cavern, any skeletons that are wearing pants have items in
their inventory.

Cross the water (PL, 1) by jumping from stone to stone. If you are
not standing as far back as possible on each stone, you will over-jump
— except when you jump to the second and next-to-last stone.

Cross the rope bridge (PL, 2).

Throw all levers without bones or skulls in front of them.

Return across the bridge and use the lever (PL, 3) in the small ruined
building to open the two large iron gates (PL, 4).

Tell him “I have many questions.”

Tell him you wish to leave [[Pagan]].

Confirm that you are not just testing him, that you truly want to leave
[[Pagan]].

Get the Recall Item from [[Mythran]]. This is vital!

Extra. Get Korghin’s Fang (M9). This dagger has increased accuracy, and
the damage of a regular sword. It is in a backpack downstairs, in a room
with two large casks.

Activate [[Mythran]]’s [[Plateau]] Recall Pad (PL, 6). It’s upstairs on the front
balcony.

Hint. 70 the northwest there is a cave with the Hammer of Strength (M6)
(PL, 8).

Use the Recall Item by double-clicking on it, and selecting “[[Tenebrae]].”

Get the Key of the Caretaker from [[Vividos]].

Warning. You must have room in your inventory to get the key, or it will
be lost!

Get all the reagents from the upstairs southern room. The bag is also
useful.

Read all the books upstairs: they teach you what you need to cast
certain spells.

Go to building north of [[Vividos]]’ graveyard.
Create a hole in the building’s (CE, 2) north wall.
Cast Open Ground spell. The wall crumbles, and beyond it lies the

first

chamber if the Upper Catacombs.

Go to the small building (UC, 2) without a roof. There is a

ghoul and a box inside. Once you walk near, the ghoul wakes up.

Walk into the building and fall through the floor to the necromancer
area.

Extra. The box has magic leggings and coins. To get them, when the floor
drops, click and hold the left button while holding the right button

down. You will catch yourself on the other side of the hole. Quickly
release then click and hold the left button to pull yourself up. Kill the
ghoul in order to get the box, then drop down the hole to the necro-
mancers. .

Hint. There are useful reagents (AN, 2) near the entrance (AN, 1) to the
Ancient [[Necromancer]] level.

Use Death Speak on first Ancient [[Necromancer]].

Learn the Summon Dead spell. Once you learn this spell the necro-
mancer teleports you to a small plateau (AN, 8).

Go to the east through electrical fences, and over the chasm.

Hint. The best way to get rid of skeletons here is to defeat them, then
throw them over the side. This is not always easy.

Use Death Speak on fourth necromancer.
Learn Grant Peace spell.

+ This is a useful spell, especially against ghosts. When you learn this

spell you are teleported to a new cave (AN, 10).

Head north, through a nest of changelings, until you come to a
structure in the center of a grassy area (AN, 11).

Hint. There are many useful reagents nearby.

Enter the structure to go to the next area (AN, 12).

Warning. It is very hazardous to pause in this area.

Walking along the walls is advisable.

Go up the stairs to the Upper Catacombs (UC, 3).

Go south, west, south, and then east, and enter the Upper Catacombs
II (UC, 4).

Go to the southwest corner of the Upper Catacombs II (U2, 2).
Throw the switch (U2, 3) to lower the gate (U2, 4).
Open the next door (U2, 5).

+ Stone Cove is an area with three entrances along the north wall. The

left entrance (SC, 1) is a cave entrance that takes you back to Upper
Catacombs II. The center entrance (SC, 2), which has tall black
doors, leads to the [[Hall of the Mountain King]]. The door on the right
(SC, 3), fronted by a wall with spikes, leads to the Pit of the Dead.
Hint. 70 the south there is a small island. On the island is Deceiver
(M7) (SCG, 4).

Cast Create Golem on the dirt outside the tall, black double-doors
(SE 2):

Tell the golem to open the doors.

Head north from the entrance (MK, 1) and jump over a chasm
(MK, 3).

Find area that has a checkered floor (MK, 4).

Climb over wall.

Throw switch next to the throne. (The switch outside the wall does
nothing.)

Kill or avoid the ghouls that pop up.

Go back close to the beginning, then head west, until you reach

a bridge (MK, 5) created by throwing the switch. (Watch out

for disappearing parts of the bridge.)

Run around the golem and follow the passage.

Jump across each of the floating platforms (MK, 6) individually.
Hint. There is a chest near here. It is out of reach, but you can use Aerial
Servant to bring it down.

You must now deal with yet another golem. Lure the golem down to
the south then run around him to the north. This gives you time to
gauge and jump to platforms that are appearing and disappearing.
Cross the platforms. The first two platforms disappear, after which

they are solid.

Head to the north until you come to the force fields (MK, 7).

You'll recognize the force fields; they are blue walls that appear
between posts, zap you and throw you back.

Hint. You can test where fields might be by tossing mushrooms. A blue
wall will flicker if there is a field. Or, if you have a couple purple potions,
consume one then run half way through, stop and take another and run
the rest of the way to the north end. (Purple potions are potions of invin-
cibility. You won't need them to go back through the maze because the
Gem of Protection in the chest (MK, 8) protects you against force fields.)
Go through the maze of force fields to find a chest (MK, 8) at the
north end. This chest contains a key and a Gem of Protection for
returning through the fields.

Take the gem and the key, and head back through the fields.

Find and open the door (MK, 9) on the west wall with the key.

Follow the corridor west then south, then west again.

Head north when the cavern opens up, until you see water with
stepping stones (MK, 10).

Jump one by one to get across.

Hint. Once you reach the water, go west along the edge of the water
until you walk out of sight. Even though you can't see yourself, take about
three more steps, jump west, and continue to follow the edge of the water
all the way around to the other side. This allows you to get around the
water without using the stepping stones.

Go north.

This hallway has passages to the west that are very difficult to see.
Take the first passage. It opens up to a cavern with changelings, blue
force fields and a chest (MK, 11) in the south west corner. In that
chest are potions of all colors.

Move the potions in the chest to get the key.

Take the key and return to the hallway.

Head north. Look for the second hard-to-see passage to the west.

Hint. At the far north end of this passage are two fading platforms that
take you to an island with an earth symbol (MK, 12). Do not go out
here yet! It teleports you back to the beginning (MK, 2) of the Hall of the
[[Mountain King]]. There is no reason to go out here yet. If you go far
enough to find a troll, then you have gone too far.

Go down the second passage. When the cavern opens up you have
no choice but to go north and jump across some water.

On the other side is a locked door (MK, 13). Open the door with
the key from the first west passage.

Go through the door and then head west to the end of the

passage. To the south at this point are more moving platforms

(MK, 14).

Jump to the first platform, then jump at an angle to the second.
Next, jump to the land itself; do not jump to the third platform. The
only difficulty here is jumping to the land when the platform is not
in the way.

Head north to [[Lithos]] (MK, 15).

Hint. Go south and look for the Recall Pad (MK, 17) so that you can
activate it for later use. Watch out for the big land symbol (MK, 16) on
the ground. This sends you back to the beginning of the Hall of the
[[Mountain King]]. At this point that would be bad. Later, it is very useful.

Ask to be [[Lithos]]’ apprentice.
Agree to perform the Ritual of Interment.

Go to the cemetery.

Inter [[Lothian]] (double-click on her).

Take the western path, following it north through the doors to the T-
intersection.

Go east. You come to a room (SH, 10) with a table, marbles strewn
on the floor and a raised platform on the other side of a fence.
Throw a marble onto the raised platform to open the gate. You may
have to back up until just the southeast tip of the platform is showing.

Hint. Stand on the skull to throw the marbles farther.

Go north through the gate into a large room (SH, 11) with two
platforms.

Get the keys which are under each platform.

Continue north.

Jump over the lightbeam tripwire (SH, 12).

Go east at the T-intersection until you come to a “stairway puzzle”

(SE 13).

Hint. The irick to the puzzle is that you can only move the stairs
“down.”

Place the clock on the platforms (numbered 1, 2, 3 from left to right)
in this order:

3,1 3,2 12 3,1 2,3
21 3,1 32 1,2 1,3
2,3 1,2 3,1 352 1,2:

A doorway opens at the top when you have completed the puzzle.
Hint. The first number of a pair should lower a stair, and the second
number should raise a stair.

Climb to the top.

Cast Rock Flesh or Withstand Death and walk through the two light
beams (SH, 14).

Go down the stairs on the far side, then west until you find a set of
tall double-doors (SH, 15) to the west.

Hint. You can use the shield you got at [[Mythran]]’ house. If you don’t
have it, you can go back to the room south of the marble room, and get

another Shield (SH, 17).

They recognize the Shield from [[Mythran]]’s house. They tell you
to enter the Tomb of [[Khumash-Gor]] and retrieve the tip of the
Obelisk. They warn you that the spirit of [[Khumash-Gor]] may still live.

Use an Opening Scroll (from [[Mythran]] (PL, 5)) to go through the
door (SH, 20) behind the [[Zealans]]. The spell does not work if the
shield is not on the altar.

[[Khumash-Gor]] appears as a ghost (SH, 21). Use Grant Peace or a
magical weapon.

Get [[Khumash-Gor]]'s scimitar (M8). It lies where the ghost once was.
Get the obelisk tip (SH, 22). It is in a box behind the throne of
[[Khumash-Gor]].

magic helm in the middle. Cast Extinguish on yourself. When
this is done the fires disappear. Get the helm and the symbol
underneath it.
