THE REAGENTS OF THAUMATURGY  
by [[Mythran]]  
  
[[Reading]] through the many tomes of [[Thaumaturgy]], the perceptive student is likely to notice something unusual about a few of the reagents. While a novice to any school of magic will find the names of most reagents unrecognizable, the reagents of [[Thaumaturgy]] are confusing for a simple reason. A universal collection of words and rituals must also have a universal set of material reagents, components that cannot be limited to a single dimension.Thus, the unusual reagents.  
  
The casual reader will focus on the obvious questions: What are these creatures? A [[Dragon]]? A [[Newt]]? [[How]] many wings does one of these bats have? [[However]], the trained mage will know that such details are irrelevant. Since magic is simply the manifestation of the caster's will rewriting the present, it stands to reason that the methods for bringing this will to the surface are not limited by the caster's plane of existence, dispelling magic notwithstanding.  
  
Therefore, as it is possible to cast spells through a variety of means, the physical representation of the components are not relevant, assuming they enable access to the necessary energies. [[In]] such an instance, the thorn of a rose may very well be a reasonable substitute for the scales of a serpent.
