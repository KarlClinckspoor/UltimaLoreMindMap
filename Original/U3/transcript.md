Nasty creatures, nasty dark, sure thee ready, fore thee embark.
None return or so I'm told, from the pool, dark and cold!
Shrines of knowledge, shrines of strength, all are lost into the brink!
Fountains fair & fountains foul, all are found in dungeons bowel.
EXODUS: Ultima ]I[, which is next? Now could it be!
Seek ye out the Lord of Time, and the one way is a sure find!

ORACLE
Radrion: Prophet of Life!
And so the sage said unto thee, 'If thou can solve my rhyme,
you'll learn of marks & playing cards & hidden holy shrines.
Of marks I say there are but 4 of fire, force, snake & king.
Learn their use in Devil Guard, or death you'll surely bring.
Shrines there are again but 4 to which you go and pray.
their uses are inumerable and clues throughout I say.
the cards their suits do number 4, called Sol, Moon, Death and Love.
Unto the Montors thou must go for guidence from above.
To aid thee in thy cryptic search, to dungeons thou must fare.
There seek out the Lord of Time to help you if he cares.'

ENDING
Congratulations! Thou hast completed Exodus: Ultima 3 in <x days, weeks, months years>. Report they feat!
And so it came to pass on this day EXODUS, hell-born incarnate of evil, was vanquished from Sosaria.
What now lies ahead in the ULTIMA saga can only be pure speculation! Onward to ULTIMA IV!
