	MISCELLANEOUS 	



INTRODUCTION
Origin proudly presents Part ][ of the #1 best selling fantasy role-playing game by Lord British Ultima ][ Revenge of the Enchantress

DEMO MODE
Battle strange creatures
Across the face of the Earth
Search for clues in careless words
Spoken at the local pub
Plead with medieval kings
For assistance
Traverse deep dark deadly dungeons
And tall terrifying towers
Travel throughout the galaxy
To the planets of our solar system
And conquer time itself to battle
Minax the Enchantress

MINAX
Minax cries: Die fool!
She's gone!!!

BARKEEPER
Barkeep says:
Isn't this a great game?
Hmmm...
Some fighters wear magic helms!
Aviators use skull keys!
Saylors wear blue tassles!
Mages carry wands or staffs!
Guards carry keys!
Ankhs open space!
Planes need brass buttons!

ORACLE
Time and travel made me wise
Precious gold, a clue it buys!
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies
The Queen is the King and the King is a Spy
The evil men do is a horrible thing
But dispelling means that you must have the ring
Just where it is, I cannot say
But I'll tell you right now, there is no other way
I hear in a town where the water runs free
There is an old man living under a tree
He has not a name but he does have a clue
Mayhaps if you find him, he'll tell it to you!

Anos: 9,000,000 B.C.
