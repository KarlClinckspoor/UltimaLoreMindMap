THE VOICES OF MARY  
By Salem  
  
I wake in the night and the rooms are all dead,  
I follow a dream; she still echoes in my head,  
The new girl is twitching, asleep on the floor,  
I move through dark rooms, and pass through the door,  
Out in the chill, I follow the walk,  
The spirits aren't speaking, so there's no need to talk,  
The moon has arisen, to flower over the world,  
While tendrils of mist snake out, and slowly unfurl,  
There's a sign by the sea that doesn't make sense,  
And out past the jetty wait sirens, horny and tense,  
Briefly, through windows in the pale glass waves,  
I see lost faces, ruined heroes in watery graves,  
I know what comes next, because I've read all my lines,  
I've been over my part, millions of times,  
As the waters roll in and I'm swallowed by sea,  
I can hear Mary whisper, calling to me,  
'Come on, baby,' from somewhere she cries,  
'I want you to love me like spiders love flies'
