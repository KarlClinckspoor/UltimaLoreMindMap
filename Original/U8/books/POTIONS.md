POTIONS  
  
From my experiments I have found that potions act in the following manner:  
Yellow: Heals, but only in small measures.  
Red: Also heals, but beware! Its strength will do damage to those not in need of its power.  
Orange: restores Mana in times of need.  
Green: Its taste is quite revolting!  
Blue: Provides restful slumber.  
Purple: Provides protection in combat. Very useful against undead.  
Black: Causes drinker to be invisible.
