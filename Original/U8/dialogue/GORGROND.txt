You will pay for that it with your life! 
Leave that alone. 
I said, leave my things alone! 
I will kill you if you move my things again! 
Now you die!

What do you want, stranger? 
Just your attention. 
I wish to speak to you. 
It's none of your business. 
Who are you? 
Alright, then leave! 
I am called 
.
I cannot tell you. 
You would not understand. 
Oh, greetings, 
. I am Gorgrond. What do you need of me?
Why not? 
If I did, I would have to kill you. 
What does it matter? 
I'm not sure. 
Ha, you'd find that hard to do. But I like you, you're funny. What do you want to know? 
Well, what do I call you if I don't know your name? 
Good question. I am 
That's your problem. 
You may call me Sir. 
Fine then, I'll call you Dungbreath. Will that do? 
No, please call me 
Yes, that will do nicely. 
No, I won't abide that. 
You will die for your insolence! 
Fine then. What do you want, Dungbreath? 
Well, it's too bad you couldn't give me your name, Dungbreath. 
I will! It's 
I don't care what you call me. 
That's it! You die! 
Good. Dungbreath it is. What do you seek here? 
I do not think so, fool. My Sorcery will bring you to your knees, then I will feed you to my pet daemon! 
Fine then. What do you want, 
?
It is you who will die, peasant! 
And you may call me your death, knave! 
Are you simple minded? Should I speak slower? Why... can't... you... tell... me... your... name? Oh, nevermind. What do you want? 
Do you take me for a fool? I am not a simplemind! My Sorcery is strong, as you will see if you anger me further. Go away now, before I loose my anger upon you. 
Dungbreath
stranger
What, 
? 
Must you pester me? 
I am not a sage. I have no great information to give to you. 
What do you want? 
Go away! I do not wish to speak with you. 
I don't like you. Leave me be! 
Disturb me no longer. 
You die, fool! 
Hello again, 
. What do you want?
What do you want of me now, 
Greetings again. What do you need? 
Farewell.
Leave me, 
Go away! 
Have a care, 
. I am no gentle giant.
I can see that you will not survive long here, 
. Good luck to you. With your tongue, you'll need it.
My temper will be kept only for so long. Go now while you still may. 
I have held my temper long enough!... No, I will not destroy you yet. But be warned, you have crossed the threshold into dangerous territory. Few have survived where you go. 
Goodbye, 
Farewell. 
This is boring, I will not wait upon your slow wit. 
Well, 
, I cannot wait here forever.
I find you irritating. Go now, 
, and do not return.
I will not kill you yet, fool. But if you ever speak to me again, you will risk death. 
Perhaps your thoughts are too much for your little mind. Think less, 
, it will serve you well.
If you wish to speak, you must first open your mouth, dullard. 
I meant no offense. 
Must you be so obstinate? 
You will tell me what I want to know! 
I will crush you! 
Nevermind. 
Some was taken, but I am a forgiving sort. What do you want of me? 
Only to those of a churlish nature. 
Leave... here... now. Else die. 
You are not worthy to live! 
You are wrong, it is you who are not worthy, and I shall prove it upon your body, knave! 
Do you know what you have done? You have allowed Bane to destroy one of the most powerful, resourceful, and courageous Sorcerers this isle has ever known. I shall never forgive you for it, even though Malchir has. Leave me be. 
Go! You have killed my closest comrade! What else would you have of me? Leave me alone! 
If you speak to me again, I shall allow you to feel the agony that you visited upon my friend! Leave or die! 
Now that Vardion has allowed you to join us, you should learn as much from him as you can. Vardion always says that a moment spent in study is worth a day spent at play. 
I thank you for helping to destroy that conniving kith, Bane. She would have driven the Sorcerers into open war with the Tenebraens. 
Prepare for the Trials of the Obsidian Fortress as best as you can. You are not allowed to leave once you have entered. 
Forgive me, for I can speak no more at the moment, matters weigh heavily upon my mind... Farewell. 
Master! I am not worthy. Forgive my lack of attentiveness. I will return to my studies. There is no need for punishment. I promise that my performance will improve. You'll see. 
Forgive me. I have offended you. I never seem to do things right. I will redouble my efforts to make your faith in me not seem misplaced. 
Don't call me Dungbreath. 
What can you tell me of this place? 
What do you do here? 
Is there anything else, 
, this is the Sorcerer's Enclave.
Tell me about Sorcerer's Enclave. 
What can you say of Sorcerers? 
I am a Sorcerer. 
Tell me your name, and I won't. 
I am called, 
Why must you know? 
I will not tell you. 
That's much better. Now we can be on speaking terms. 
I don't, I just will continue to call you Dungbreath until I know a name to call you. 
Fine then, call me, 
You will never know. 
Fine, Dungbreath. 
Let me see, 
. It's in a ravine. It's filled with lava. Hmmm... Yes, that's about it.
You're not very bright, are you? 
I see. That was helpful. 
What an... esoteric description. 
Oh, quite a bit. I am most knowledgeable, you know. I have studied here for a long time. Since I was a babe. 
Well... What can you say? 
You were born here? 
I find that hard to believe. 
Not really very bright, are you? 
Smart enough not to speak to someone who insults me! 
Thank you. Glad to be of aid. Vardion always says that I am so mercifully free of cluttering thoughts. I'm not sure what he means, but he smiles when he says it. So it must be good. 
Vardion? Tell me of him. 
You -are- free of thought. 
I think he means you are stupid. 
It is good to have friends. 
Do you think so? What's esso?... Bane uses that word sometimes. She's not nice like Vardion. What do you mean? 
Nothing. Don't worry about it. 
Tell me what you know of Bane. 
Hmmm? About what, 
About Sorcerer's Enclave! 
Of course. Are you a simpleton? All Pagans are born on this island. Not very smart, are you? 
I meant, here in the Enclave. 
No, really. I was a child at one time. 
No. Your knowledge is suspect. 
He is the greatest Pagan alive. Um, except for the Master, perhaps. He knows so many things. It hurts my head to even think about what he knows. 
Why is he so great? 
Can you tell me what he knows? 
Who is the Master. 
I can tell you this... You are beginning to anger me! 
Why, is she a friend of yours? 
As a matter of fact, yes. 
No, of course not. 
Why do you ask? 
I have already told you. She is a back-stabbing, foul-tempered, mean-spirited wench. 
Vardion has plans for her. 
Tell me his plans. 
And I think you are a dolt! 
Yes, and Vardion is the best friend to have. 
Thank you. But you are not very original, 
I won't. 
A suspect of what? 
Do you know anything of value? 
That's it. I've had it. Goodbye! 
Oh, yes. I was born in this room. 
 I don't remember anything about it though. So don't ask.
Because he is the First Acolyte, and... because he said so. 
What is a First Acolyte? 
Acolyte? What is that? 
Do you believe everything he says? 
No! I told you it hurts to even think about it. You must be deaf. 
Master Malchir is the leader of the Sorcerers. 
Tell me about Master Malchir. 
How did Malchir become leader? 
Well, guard your back well. You would be suprised what might sprout from it, with her as your 'friend'. 
Well, you should know that Vardion has some plans concerning her. 
Because she is a back-stabbing, foul-tempered, mean-spirited wench. And she hates me. I don't know why, but now I hate her too. Again, is she your friend? 
I know that you are beginning to irritate me. And that I don't have to listen to you. Leave me be. 
No, I can't do that. You have to ask him yourself. 
Why should I? You aren't a Sorcerer. And if you want to be one, you should talk to Vardion. I don't have the patience to train you. 
How should I know? He was Master when I started learning to walk. In my first memories, I remember hearing him say that I would be a strong Acolyte one day. This seemed to bring him great pleasure. 
That is the Sorcerer who runs the Enclave in the Master's absence. Really, that's just about all the time. 
You're looking at one. 
What does being an Acolyte entail? 
Yes. He has never lied to me yet. He told me so. 
We assist the Master with his rituals, 
. He draws upon our power to replace his when it wanes.
What rituals? 
I can't tell you. You are not a Sorcerer. 

I can't understand you. What did you say?
