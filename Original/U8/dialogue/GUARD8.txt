Guardsman! 
You must find safety, stranger, for the Titans spew their hatred upon us! 
Quickly seek shelter from the death that walks and the ground that quakes, stranger, lest you find death yourself. The once-buried now roam freely and must be stopped! 
Always hassling me! What do you want this time? 
Is there something I can do for you? 
Always with the questions! 
What do you want, stranger? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
Bye 
I am called Pellgun. 
I am charged with protecting the Tempest, Devon. 
I am charged with protecting the Lady Mordea. 
You are in the royal palace of the Tempest, Devon. 
You are in the royal palace of the Lady Mordea. 
You had best be off before Mordea demands your head for trespassing. 
Very good. 
I thank you for your assistance is deposing the tyrannical Mordea. Her unfair rulership has been brought to an end, thanks to you.
