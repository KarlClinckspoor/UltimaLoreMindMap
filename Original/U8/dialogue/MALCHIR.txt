Ah, I see you have endured the trials of the Obsidian Fortress, which means that you must have nearly completed your training. I will test you now, Disciple, to see if you are worthy to be an Acolyte. 
In order to become one, you must first cast three spells. You may use my pentacle, one of my staves, and my reagents to prepare them. I will be the target of each. Fear not, for they will do me no harm. 
First, cast the Flame Bolt spell, then the Explosion spell, and finally, summon a Daemon to assault me. Do this in order. Failure at this point will cost your life... and there is no turning back. 
The test begins now... 
Cast the Flame Bolt spell at me. 
Cast the Explosion spell at me. 
Summon a daemon to attack me. 
Banish the daemon. 
Drop the staff. 
Do it now. 
This is your last chance. You are about to fail... and that means your death. 
I did not send for you, insolent child. This fortress is my refuge, and for breaking its sanctity, you must die. 
Come, Acolyte. We must begin the ceremony.
