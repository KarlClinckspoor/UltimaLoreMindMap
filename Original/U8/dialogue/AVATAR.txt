Nevermind!
Bzzzzt! Thank you for playing!
I -really- do appreciate your plight, Avatar. 
Ah, Avatar, the thrill of conquest is so... invigorating. 
Enjoying your stay on Pagan, Avatar? 
Hark! Is that the sweet song of lamentation I hear? 
I do so enjoy the cries of torment. 
Yes, Avatar, seek a way home. 
There is no escape from -this- prison! 
Hurry, Avatar. After all, you have only -all- -of- -eternity- to complete your tasks. 
Nystul sends his best, Avatar... 
You should hear the pleas for help, Avatar. 
At this very moment, Britannia burns. 
One world lies in ruin, nothing more than a charred shell. The other will soon follow. 
Perhaps I should destroy you now. 
Care you no more for your own world, Avatar? 
Will your precious Earth fall so easily? 
Soon I shall be able to call Britannia mine. It seems, Avatar, that you are missed here. Why, I believe I hear Lord British crying out for you now... 
Your treasured Britannia succumbs easily. Soon -all- the land will be mine. 
Ouch! -That- must have hurt, Avatar! 
Do not go near -that-, Avatar. 
ha hahahaha 
he he he he 
Feel my wrath! 
Let the darkness come for you, Avatar.
