Guardsman! 
Run for you life, fool! The Titans have gone mad! 
Lithos makes the land quake and the dead rise. Run, fool, and hide before the very city falls to the undead onslaught. 
What now? 
What can I do for you? 
What questions do you have now? 
What do you want, stranger? 
Who are you? 
What is your duty? 
Where am I? 
Bye 
I am the one who is going to be poking a certain meddler with a halberd, if he does not mind his	own business. 
Understand? 
What does it look like? My job is pounding these cobblestones back down into the dirt. They keep coming out of the roadway. 
Fool... 
What do I look like? A guide? 
Leave me, I must be about my duties! 
Fine. I must get back to work.
