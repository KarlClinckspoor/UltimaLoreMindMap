CATACOMB SCROLL  
  
Dear Sir- It has come to my attention that the floors of your bloody catacombs have proven to be rather faulty if not downright dangerous. Why, when I was there just two days past, visiting my one and only beautiful daughter, who lies interred there, my lovely wife, Forencia, fell through the floor to her death! I can only recommend that you close the catacombs until the floors can be made safer, for I truly would have to hunt you down and indeed cease your beating heart should another of my kin fall to their death. Yours Truly, Sysaphus

CATACOMB SCROLL  
  
Mental note:  
Fix floors (those water puddles weaken mortar)  
Clean cobwebs  
Remove all trash (have Pedert take all food out)  
Have Jaynela write letter to Sysaphus  
Talk to Vugrinec about bandage wearing in public.
