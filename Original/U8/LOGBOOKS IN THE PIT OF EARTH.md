LOGBOOKS IN THE PIT OF EARTH  
I can go no further. These blasted magical walls have taken my strength, and I am afraid, my life. Too late have I discovered a way to detect the walls without cost to myself.These humble mushrooms that litter the floor awake the wall's power when tossed at them! Alas, I can only eat these mushrooms. Perhaps they may bring me strength to escape this cavern... I lie here awaiting the end. I know now that I will never see Lithos, curse these frail bones of mine. My strength is not great enough to withstand these tests. My only hope is that my twin brother will make it though without me. My hopes and spirit rest with him... Should anyone find this note, please tell him of my passing. Thank you, Bryan
