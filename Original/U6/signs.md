This scroll is filled with Lord British's notes on his astronomical observations.

"With love, from cousin Manrel."

If you're looking for the clue, there's something for you under a plant in Serpent's Hold.

Your next hint is under a beehive in Minoc.

You're doing well! Next you should search the harpsichord in the Blue Bottle Tavern.

Well done! Now go search the beds in the jail in Yew.

Most people would have given up by now... But since you haven't, you can find the next hint under a cauldron in New Magincia.

You're almost there! Search the stone lions in Lord British's castle.

Ho eyo he hum! You've won, you've won! Go to Iolo's @hut and ask Smith the horse to tell you the @clue!

This painting portrays a square staircase with no beginning or end. There are a number of hooded monks facing in both directions. As you look at the painting, you notice that the monks in the picture are moving, very slowly, ascending and descending the staircase endlessly.

This is a painting of a painting hanging on a wall. The painting within the painting is of a pipe, floating in midair, with smoke curling up from its bowl. The frame in the painting has a little plaque on it that says "This is not a pipe."

This painting shows a strangely familiar scene. In a small museum, several people stand regarding a painting hanging on the wall. You see only their backs. You reach up to scratch your head, and one of the figures in the painting does likewise. It's you! This painting shows whatever happens in front of it, like a mirror, but it shows you the other side of everything, as if it were hanging on the opposite wall.

This is a a very fancy portrait of you. At the bottom of the frame, a small plaque reads simply "The Avatar". The portrait is signed "Woodroffe" in the lower right hand corner.

This is a painting by the famous Captain Fox.

This painting is by the renowned artist Helen Garriott.
( Helen Garriott is Richard's mother, who is a decent artist in her own right, and did much of the original artwork for Ultima III. )

This painting bears the signature of the well known artist Musgrave.

This is a painting by the respected artist Elmore.

This painting shows a satyr playing panpipes for the creatures of the forest. It bears the signature of the highly talented Monica Knighton.

This is a painting of a tiger and a dragon, poised to do battle, painted by the incomparable Elissa Martin.
( Wife of Ultima IX project director Brian Martin. )
