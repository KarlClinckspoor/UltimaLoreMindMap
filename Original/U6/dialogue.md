(Note: The transcription of Ultima VI is taking a very long time.  This list contains the conversations of the first and part of the second of three sets of characters, and includes 106 of the 202 total characters in the game.  I'm still working on the second batch, and could sure use some help.)

This is a transcript of the NPC conversations from the game Ultima VI: The False Prophet.  There are a few special notations to watch for.  An at symbol (@) in front of a word means that word was a "keyword", and would optionally appear in red while playing the game, to tip off the player about what topics an NPC would respond to. However, those were not the only keywords characters would respond to; far from it!  Other symbols using a dollar sign ($) or pound sign (#) followed by a number (e.g. $1 #2 $5, etc.) signify special strings, like the Avatar's name or the time of day, that would be substituted back into the scripts when printed to the screen.  It's fairly easy to see what the values should be in most cases, so I've left the original symbols intact.  The first character isn't really a conversation at all; it's the infamous cheat menu you get inside the game by saying the words "humbug, humbug, humbug, spam" to Iolo.

"Those that dwell in the woods have lives of their own, more interesting to me than the ways of townfolk. There is much to be learned from the animals, if you will but listen." Dupre says "Now Shamino's going on about talking to animals... The whole world's going batty!"

Dupre cuts in. "Iolo! You promised NEVER to tell anyone about that!" "Yes, you're right. I'm sorry." He whispers to you, "Ask me later when he's not around..."

"Thou art correct."
"Find thy Compendium, then come speak with me again."
"Ah, 'tis thee indeed, $4. Take this key. It will unlock the gatehouse by the southern entrance to the castle. Then you can use the lever inside to raise the portcullis. The same key will also let you into the sewers under the castle. Now let me tell thee what hath transpired since thy last visit. The vast underworld from which thou didst rescue me hath collapsed. Yet still there are forces of evil abroad in the land. Britannia is under attack by gargoyles such as those thou just fought. Thus far they have mainly been attacking the @shrines of the eight @virtues. When the Shrine of Compassion didst fall, Sir @Geoffrey sent a party to free it. Do thou ask him of this mission. Of course, thou mayst feel free to borrow anything in my castle, if thou shouldst need it. Lastly, any time thou dost need @healing, do thou but ask me. If thou doth wish me to @repeat all this later, thou need but ask."

"My favorite story is '@Hubert the Lion.'"

6. Nystul
You see a concerned looking mage. 
"Hail to thee $2, and well met. 'Twas I who learned of thy peril through my mystic arts, so that aid might be sent unto thee. Iolo, I saw that thou didst find a book. Might I examine it?"
"I no longer have the book, milord." replies Iolo. "That is too bad. I had hoped thou might take it to Mariah and have her translate it."
"Certainly, milord. Perhaps thou canst make better sense of it than I." says Iolo. "Strange... This has a picture on its cover of a gargoyle standing with one foot on the chest of a slain human. This is interesting. It's written in a language I know not. Take it to Mariah at the Lycaeum, the finest scribe on the great Council of Wizards.  She has studied many languages, and perhaps she can decipher this book for thee. One more thing, Avatar... I noticed that thou didst arrive through a red gateway. Dost thou have the stone that opened the gate?"
"From whence could it have come? The gargoyles, perhaps? Best ask Lord British about it. I believe he has some knowledge of such items."
"Such items are quite rare. Indeed, the only one I have ever seen is that which Lord British himself possesses. 
Hast thou gone to the Lycaeum and shown Mariah the book? 'Tis most important. There is naught else I can help thee with at this time." 




7. Geoffrey
You see a tall, handsome man.
"Thou hadst best speak to Lord British before aught else."
"I'm glad to see thee, $4. Perhaps thou canst prevail where others could not. I sent a party of ten to recapture the Shrine of Compassion from the gargoyles. Alas, they failed dismally. The survivors are recuperating in the town of Cove. Thou wouldst do well to speak with them first. Mayhap they learned something which might aid thee. I must confess I fear the worst. The gargoyles are such powerful foes, and they are spreading so fast... Perhaps the end of the realm is nigh. Good luck, and my prayers go with thee. Best not waste time talking... Who knows what acts of villainy the gargoyles are comitting even as we speak? I hope you've had a chance to visit Cove and speak with Gertan."

"The rune and mantra of Compassion are in the keeping of the bards at the @Conservatory. I entrusted them with the rune due to their compassionate nature. As for the other runes - they are no longer together, as they were when the @Codex was recovered. Since then, they have become scattered throughout the land. Each was sent to a town near its shrine. If thou dost ask the lords of each of these towns, they should be able to tell thee more. The towns are Moonglow, Jhelom, Yew, Minoc, Trinsic, Skara Brae, and New Magincia."

The match began the grim men fought, to gather in her sails. But thunderous was the crack and lo, the mighty vessel reeled. When gentle winds danced 'cross the surf, again the followed morn. 'twas nothing left of Dutchy's hull but remnants of her born. And now the tale has nothing left, but a gravesight on the floor. On the Fens o' the Dead she came to rest, ne'er to sail no more."

"That's a very curious device. The motion of each gear turns another, until eventually the movement is propagated back to the same gear again. There's one thing I can't figure out. We've made plans of the device, and I can't see how they started it moving in the first place. None of the gears would turn unless all the others were already going. What's worse, the motions serve to hold the machine together. If the gears were still, the whole thing would fall apart! How it was built is quite a mystery."

"This piece I have had for quite some time, and I've learned all I can from it."
"Ah, thou hast found the rest of the tablet! Go get the other half from my study and bring it here. With the two of them together I should be able to tell you more."

book
"Nystul sent word to me that thou hast a book written in a strange tongue. I'd not mind looking at it for thee... But I'd find the task much easier if thou wouldst bring it here!"
"I'd be glad to look at it for thee." She examines the book. "Oh! I've seen this script before! I have part of an ancient silver tablet in my study with writing both in our language and this. I have learned only a little from studying it, but I can make out a few words."
"The title is 'The Book of Prophecies,' and it says something about 'the end of our world.' If only I had the other half of the @tablet, perhaps I'd be able to decipher the rest of the book."
"With both pieces of the tablet, I should be able to work out a translation." She studies the tablet for a while, and then starts reading, haltingly, from the book. An ancient prophecy tells of the final days, when the end of our world shall come.*Three signs will precede the end. Thrice shall a being of great evil come unto our land, and by this it shall be known that the end is nigh. This evil one is of another race, who consider the evil one a great prophet. Yet this false prophet follows not the principles of Control, Passion and Diligence. One day the false prophet will come and desecrate our most holy shrine. And the false prophet will steal our most holy artifact, the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This shall be the first sign of the end. Then, it is written, the false prophet shall descend deep into the bowels of the earth. And the false prophet will cause the underworld to collapse. This will cause great earthquakes to tear our world asunder, and there will be a time of plague and famine. This shall be the second sign of the end. One last time shall the false prophet come. This time, the false prophet will come with a band of warriors. And they will destroy all that remains of the gargoyle race. There is only one way that this prophecy may be averted: That is by the sacrifice of the false prophet. Mariah pauses for a while, deep in thought. "When they refer to 'the false prophet,' they must mean you." she says. "It would seem that they have reason to think you evil, from their perspective. This is a difficult matter to resolve. I think you'd better seek out more information. There's a gargoyle named Sin'Vraal living out in the desert. He speaks our language. Perhaps he could tell you more about this book, and of how the gargoyles view us."

It would be very tricky to duplicate, being magical in nature, but I believe I might be able to do it. The material and the nature of the enchantment appear similar to those involved in the making of glass swords. If I could keep this to analyze while you go get me a glass sword, I'll try and make a copy for you." Before you can protest, he pockets the lens. "Let me know when you have the glass @sword."

Now I'll melt down the glass sword and try to cast a lens for you." You watch as he works, intently focused on his task. Finally he pronounces the job a success.

The owner, Immanuelle, doesn't know what to do. Along come the gypsies. 'Aiee!' they cry. 'Yonder nag hath contracted 'Arturosis.' Unless it be immediately removed, the rest shall catch the same fatal disease.' Immanuelle decides to sacrifice the diseased one and the gypsies agree heartily. 'For but a few coins,' say the gypsies,' we will lead it away and bury it far from here.' Immanuelle is too happy to hand them the doomed animal's bridle, plus ten coins. So the gypsies make a great kettle of horse stew and bury the rest. A great feast is held 'mongst gypsykind. Meanwhile, Immanuelle thanks virtue that the equine epidemic was caught early on!

86. Yorl
You see a huge, imposing man adorned in a leather apron.
"Good $5, friend." He extends a huge hand which resembles a slab of meat.
"Ah!" He rumbles up to you with a large, bloody hook. You feel like bolting, but then he drops it in a pocket on his apron and extends a bloody hand. He smells strongly of fish. "What do ya need?"

name
"Yorl. A short name, but a @strong one!"

"My @father was a coastal @raider.But don't let that out." He lets out a holler and laughs loudly.

He suddenly stops laughing and looks at you, his eyes angry and wide. "Who told you?" With that he throws his head back and laughs again.

"Yes, I had one." He hollers again, this time slapping you on the back.

"I'm a fisherman. 'Tisn't quite as exciting as some jobs, but it keeps me near the @sea."

"Oh, aye, love the sea I do. Even if the @fishing's been poor of late."

"Fish come, fish go. Right now, the fish have gone. But they'll come back!And when they do, I'll be waitin' for 'em with my @nets!"

"Aye, you haveta use nets to do serious fishing. A @pole'll never catch you enough to sell."

"Never use 'em myself. I stick to nets--faster and easier. Man's gotta make a living!"

ghos
"That's a @tale they tell in town. I've seen no spirits. Except at old Stivius'."

tale
"You know, 'bout @Marn's pa haunting the @vineyard." He leans closer wiping his hands on his apron. "I think @Stivius has been drinkin' his profits."

"I took it from Quenton's dead body to give to Marney for safe keeping."

marn
"She's the loveliest thing ever seen in these parts. I'm her father now. And if any man should want her hand, he'd better be able to take me square!" He gives you a huge grin and flexes a massive bicep.

vine
"They say that @Quen's ghost haunts that area of town. I can't imagine why. The sea was his lifeblood."

stiv
He removes a large hook from his pocket and begins to clean it as he talks. "He's a strange little guy. They say he's the only one who saw Quen murdered. I wish we'd had a better witness." He flips the hook over and over examining it. "Still, those Gargoyles would frighten any man. 'Specially one as small as him."

quen
"He and I were mates. I can still remember the moment @they told me he was dead." He swallows hard and his eyes become glassy. "I miss old Quen."

"@Gideon and @Stivius. They came to my house before dawn and told me that Quen had been killed by @gargoyles."

"I never seen a one. I seen alot o' things out at sea, @serpents as big as the biggest four-@master. But 'nary a single gargoyle." He looks out towards the sea.

"One o' the tall ships. My father used to pilot one o' the biggest in Lord @British's fleet. The Merideth @Ann. She was a sight to behold, she was."

"She'd seen many a battle with pirates. Then she went to her grave in a @storm. Took nearly two hundred men with her."

He stops trying to relight his pipe and looks at you. "Where have you been @scuttled? That's too long a story for this $5."

"Never mind." He sticks his hands in his apron.

He turns his head back towards you, purses his lips, then speaks. "It was a calm night, it was. Quen and I had 'cided to go out on that glassy sea for a fish. Not just any fish, mind ya, a @light-horn."

ligh,horn
"When we were boys, Quen's father often talked about such a fish. Said if a body could @catch one, good fortune would be his."

catc,good,fort
"Yes, good fortune. He said the fish had a glowing horn on it's snout. It only comes close to the surface when the sea is like @glass."

"You see, the fish thought the surface was a mirror and it came up to admire its horn." He chuckles to himself, teeth clenched around the pipe. "Anyway, Quen and I 'cided we'd catch us one in our @skiff."

He pulls the pipe from his mouth and blows some smoke rings. "Well, even though the skiff was small, we figured that we'd @spear the beast and drag it back to port."

"I know it sounds crazy now, but you have to remember, we were only boys. Anyway, we rowed out past Ivers @Rounding and sat in our skiff waiting to see one." He looks out to sea again and chuckles.

"You know, past where the @alchemist lives. Anyway, we sat there for hours with 'nary a sign of life...Then, suddenly, in the distance we could see a tall @neck rising out of the water and heading towards us."

"Old Horance? He's a crazy old coot who lives on the isle."

tall,neck
"As it came closer, a huge wave preceded it and we could make out a giant mouth." He takes his pipe from his mouth and gestures at you. "I tell you, you've never seen two boys make a skiff travel so fast in all your life." He laughs out loud, this time bending over to support himself.

"He's a stuffy one. Never likes to come down here, says it smells."

"She's a heavily rigged one, she is." He winks at you and laughs.

heal
"You look fine to me."

"You don't look poisoned."
"Perhaps you have a hangover, 'cause none of you are poisoned."
"Which of you?"
"You look poisoned to me." She nods at $6. "It'll cost you 10 gold, interested?"
$3 grabs a vial and pours it down $6's throat. $6 feels much better.
"You must pay before I can heal you."

"What? But you carry no dead body!"
"I see that $6 carries a departed friend. Resurrection costs 200 gold, interested?"

"Yes, you know, make him demonstrate his answers by, say, shaking a branch."

"It is in a @poem my mother wrote to him when they first met." She grabs a @locket that hangs around her neck and opens it. Inside is a folded piece of cloth with words printed on it. She begins to read. "At first we met and dark clouds gathered, the thunder sounding your approach. Then comes the storm of our hearts pounding and in the end the marney's touch."

poem
"Certainly you can look at it." She hands the tiny cloth to you. Looking at it, you discover that she has read only the first verse of the poem. The second reads, "If I should leave and you are lonely, Remember where my love is kept: Inside a @basket made of promise, You'll find my dreams of us have slept."

"Oh, Yorl." She smiles to herself. "He and father were never apart. After my mother was kidnapped, Yorl helped my father get back on his feet. They were always together." Her gaze returns to you. "If my @father had been drinking at the @inn, Yorl would have been there."

With a jingle vang jingle vang jingle vang jingle,
With a jingle vang jingle vang jingle hi ho.
'I will' said the smith and they went off together,
Unto the young damsel's forge they did go.
They stripped to go to it--'twas hot work and hot weather,
She kindled the fire and she soon made him glow.
With a jingle vang jingle vang jingle vang jingle,
With a jingle vang jingle vang jingle hi ho!
I hope you enjoyed the song!"
